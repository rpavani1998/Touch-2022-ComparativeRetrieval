in part due to the success of the quake engine, solid support for opengl became important enough to motivate makers of 3d cards to provide complete drivers.opengl may not have gotten the changes it needed to compete with directx as a gaming graphics api.as far as i know, dx11 features is not possible on the open platforms like the ps3 or 4 so multiplatform games will always look and run better (provided that dx11 does what it says it will do) on the xbox3 thus annihilating the console market.it actually introduced innovations of its own like support for vertex and pixel shaders.so, for several years, direct3d’s capabilities were beyond the curve, with an interface that many programmers found a lot more confusing than opengl’s.opengl can go screw backwards compatibility, look what it's done to (competent) web designers who are stuck dealing with internet explorer.unless you're using windows, which is proprietary, the only viable alternative cannot be used because of the fear of losing compability.sgi, whose main source of revenue was the sale of expensive 3d workstations, was in a bad position, having failed to foresee that the explosion of 3d cards for gamers would prompt ati and nvidia to move into the professional market with prices so low (due to economies of scale) that sgi couldn’t keep up.i know that professional 3d programs like max and maya run much smoother on d3d even when run on the non-crippled version of opengl (on workstation cards).the engineers in redmond worked very hard to bring performance up to its rival api’s level.it would be nice if it became a viable anything-other-then-a-web-server viable platform though.also, for 3ds max specific, you are able to have real time shadows and lightning conditions in viewports, but only under d3d.i use several autodesk products for engineering and autodesk made it clear about 1.5 years ago that their 3d products would only support directx in the future.conclusion given the prevalence of directx nowadays, we tend to forget that 10 years ago an all-out war was being waged between microsoft and silicon graphics in the field of 3d apis.with directx 9, microsoft managed to strike a decisive victory, imposing its api on developers.
