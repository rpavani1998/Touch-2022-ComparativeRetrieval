they also credit other open source programmers specializing in graphics for contributing the help they needed to accomplish this specific task.aside from the opengl and sdl apis, the rest of the codebase is original and was written in c by the bishop brothers."our main problem is that we haven't gotten around to porting the network code from the original directx. i think it would be a pretty straightforward job for a competent programmer with some spare time.ben, who wrote some of the ai, feels this is unfortunate because it has probably hindered further development by others who might want to help to improve it.other map-making tools for egoboo are also available and in development, including egomap, which adds random level generation to the game.he suggests that it might be best to start by contributing to the development of the original dungeon crawl, a more likely way to gain better technical insight into the engine's code.as mentioned above, particle graphics do not rotate in the opengl version of the game like they do in the direct3d original.they did borrow the quake ii model format for game characters, however, to avoid the work of writing their own modeling program from scratch." the egoboo project could also use contributions of character and object models for the game and definitely needs more level maps."if anyone reading this ever writes a graphic program, wrap the graphics api calls in macros!" ben points out that opengl itself was not the problem in this process: "opengl has been a pleasure to work with.so i'd like say what would get me to do a new release: a new level, significant bug fixes (networking, particles, etc.), and a good new [development] tool.an extra, obvious benefit is that this decision makes customizing egoboo much easier: the mod community is full of people who are familiar with creating quake ii models.as is standard in dungeon adventures, game play consists of combat against monsters, spell-casting, and exploring a variety of map levels." in the end, ben is proudest not of the technical achievements that he, his brother, and various volunteers have made to egoboo, but, rather, the game's very place within the overall open source gaming scene.ben points out that opengl itself was not the problem in this process: "opengl has been a pleasure to work with.
