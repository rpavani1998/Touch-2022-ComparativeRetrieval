an extra, obvious benefit is that this decision makes customizing egoboo much easier: the mod community is full of people who are familiar with creating quake ii models.

"if anyone reading this ever writes a graphic program, wrap the graphics api calls in macros!" ben points out that opengl itself was not the problem in this process: "opengl has been a pleasure to work with.
they also credit other open source programmers specializing in graphics for contributing the help they needed to accomplish this specific task.
figure 2 -- a peaceful outdoor scene, unless you're a sheep to those interested in modifying the egoboo code to create an entirely different type of game, bishop warns that the learning curve for the engine is pretty steep.
ben, who wrote some of the ai, feels this is unfortunate because it has probably hindered further development by others who might want to help to improve it.
as is standard in dungeon adventures, game play consists of combat against monsters, spell-casting, and exploring a variety of map levels.
other map-making tools for egoboo are also available and in development, including egomap, which adds random level generation to the game.
the original code from direct3d was a complete mess.
ben says this may partly be because support for the lua language in egoboo "is not 'fully baked' as of now, from what i know."
"converting direct3d to opengl was like getting teeth pulled," describes ben.
in terms of its design, the inspiration for its game play draws uponnethack.
" in the end, ben is proudest not of the technical achievements that he, his brother, and various volunteers have made to egoboo, but, rather, the game's very place within the overall open source gaming scene.
as mentioned above, particle graphics do not rotate in the opengl version of the game like they do in the direct3d original.
"so i think egoboo is contributing by enlarging the pool of games." howard wen is a freelance writer who has contributed frequently to o'reilly network and written forsalon.com, playboy.com, and wired, among others.
"our main problem is that we haven't gotten around to porting the network code from the original directx. i think it would be a pretty straightforward job for a competent programmer with some spare time.
this game premise might sound, well, silly, but it's silly by design.
the networking challenge is typical for this type of game.
it is possible for others to study the existing ai scripts and documentation, but he admits it is not easy to figure out.
aside from the opengl and sdl apis, the rest of the codebase is original and was written in c by the bishop brothers.
they also credit other open source programmers specializing in graphics for contributing the help they needed to accomplish this specific task.
in fact, ben says his brother has already developed some of his own: "aaron always seemed to get distracted and [would] code up new games using the egoboo engine.

there are still some lingering problems from the conversion, though, such as our flaky support for particles.
"good open source games are few and far between," he says.

egoboo features real-time action and 3d graphics.
ben points out that opengl itself was not the problem in this process: "opengl has been a pleasure to work with.
they did borrow the quake ii model format for game characters, however, to avoid the work of writing their own modeling program from scratch.
as far as the game's ai, its scripting is specific to egoboo.
while the game looks very good in its current form, it does not have a polished feel of a commercial game, which ben admits and wants to see improved.
"our main problem is that we haven't gotten around to porting the network code from the original directx. i think it would be a pretty straightforward job for a competent programmer with some spare time.

" the egoboo project could also use contributions of character and object models for the game and definitely needs more level maps.
" while the character models are done in quake ii format, egoboo uses a separate tool, developed for egoboo, calledcartman, for map generation.

in something like a real-time strategy, you might not notice if your units take a half-second to start moving.
while the game is nowhere near complete, egoboo's current form still has plenty of dungeon romping and monster-bashing.
fixing the particle graphics is easy, says ben, but the network issue will be tougher to resolve.
