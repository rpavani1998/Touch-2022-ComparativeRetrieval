i'm trying to get asynchronous slide loading in opt to don't waste so much memory while loading pdf presentations.
the personal side work keeps me busy enough to being unable to accomplish the promise i made myself to release a gtk+ msi installer before guadec.
working on sun is being great so far, at last i have the opportunity to learnsome things that i've been delaying for too long.
latest commentsfrom linus about the gplv3 sounds promising, but even more promising is the response fromjonathan.
as i said on my previous post, i would like to see the lines that divides opensolaris and linux, as blurred as possible (or deleted).
: youtube / ogg so far, what the patch does is create one slide per pdf page on the document and animate each actor on the slide.
alexander larsson is working on gvfs, a new api for accessing files and perform io operations, that whips gnome-vfs' ass in terms of simplicity and portability.
since this is a community effort, i won't wait to anyone in sun marketing to make a logo (sorry guys :p), so i've done my own: indiana was the name's of indiana jones' dog, and if i remember correctly, it was a husky.
it tries to adress some issues and it has a name, an identity and a direction.
the easier people is able to adapt opensolaris for their needs, the most problems it solves, and the most adoption it gets.
i would like to add pdf transition support and maybe slide caching at some point.

but a nice text help when you use "top" trying to help users to gather the same information they expect (something like what ubuntu does now when you type a missing command) would help a lot of people.
i would also like to point out that, inidiana is a binary distribution project inside the opensolaris.org community, and right now is anything but a discussion mailing list and a bunch of good ideas and intentions, so nothing to do with gnome patches for solaris and solaris express.
this is the first time that i do any kind of computer animation, and given the fact that my c skills are not any extraordinary, and that i did this hack in 1 hour (most of the time looking at others .h
posted at 01:52 pm | permalink | comments (3) | reblog (0) one of the first things that i missed when i realized that my laptop was lost was (beside tons of photos and college documentation) a couple of old hacks, most of them on pygtk, more than a year ago i started lurking on the #art-gnome channel trying to add atom feeds toart.gnome.org, benzea did a great job adding support to art.gnome.org back then.
almost native performance and concurrent execution of various games like quake3 or unreal.
lots of old-school solaris users are afraid of a gnu/opensolaris thing, and neither indiana is a gnu/opensolaris effort nor all gnu tools are bad as evil.
this is a core asset of the gnome platform since it encourage our so beloved freedom of choice.
this excites me because i would like to see the days when hostility between opensolaris and the linux community is over (at the same time i also think that the gplv3 would be a huge step), but at the same time, making people from the most adopted unix-like operating system out there comfortable on opensolaris would be a huge step (for both projects and the whole free software community).
on the other hand i realized today via footnotes, that anjuta 2.2, the first stable release of the 2.x series has been released, congratulations to the developers.
and the most important thing, make easy fo r them to work on building their own tools from yours one.

darren has alreadyanswered to the avahi issue, sometimes, is not as easy as sun does not get it, but, some projects just don't get it that api stability decisions does matters to avoid crappiness, bugginess and bronkeness in the long term.
some of them funny, othersÂ  just mandatory, but i'm enjoying my time here as i've never did in the past, i couldn't have thought in any better first full-time job in my life.
i think that we can say, from a empirical and scientific point of view that theclutter api is extremely easy to use, in a nutshell, it rocks!
fortunately, there was a copy of the hack on my gmail history, and jilorio backgrounds has come alive again.
we have the wider and best maintained set of bindings for a graphical toolkit, just take a look at the development activity inpygtk, ruby-gnome, java-gnome, gtkmm.. (the list goes on).
developing gnome is going to rock even more very soon!
however, i had a great fun, and it was great to stay there again.
i would also like to point out that, inidiana is a binary distribution project inside the opensolaris.org community, and right now is anything but a discussion mailing list and a bunch of good ideas and intentions, so nothing to do with gnome patches for solaris and solaris express.
once the support was added, i hacked a small pygtk app to use the feed to select backgrounds from the site and apply them without browser interaction.

and the same time, it tries to let others people to make their own flavors of opensolaris with a low entry barrier.
most times i'm faithful about the human kind, today is not one of those days.

what a crazy week, the first day i lose my backpack with my laptop and my home's keys, so it wasn't a good start.
some of them funny, others just mandatory, but i'm enjoying my time here as i've never did in the past, i couldn't have thought in any better first full-time job in my life.
so here we are, i now can see the day where linux and solaris can reach a common point.

if you are looking for an easy hack, metacity and gtk themes variants of the app would be really cool.

(it also means, that our friends from openedhand rocks too).
when i started to getting involved with gnome, i missed some features and got frustrated on how many details i needed to know to solve simple problems.
this is the scary landscape: sadly, those are not clouds.
meanwhile, it seems that we can do better with our patch policy.

there is also another forest fire on tenerife, the authorities suspect that it's also intentional.

laszlo peters (laca), from the jds common build environment fame, has granted me today commit access to the sfe repository: sending changelog sending sfegit.spec transmitting file data ..

it seems that gtk 2.12 is going to include the gtkbuilder api that johan has been developing for a while, this is going to allow to abtract a lot of details, it not only replace libglade and uimanager, but also, it will be possible to define treeview columns and even populate data on it from a ui designer, such designer doesn't exist yet, this ui is yet to be created, but again, time will fix this.
being away from home is making it even more strange.
there are also people complaining about having too many distributions would be harmful for opensolaris because people wouldn't know which one to choose.

you can check the software available on the repositoryhere.
the reason because i think this is because i'm a strongly community guy, and i do think that a good healthy and friendly community is the most important assent to any free software project.

one of the most beautiful landscapes of my island, lost.
i'm starting to seriously believe that this kind of progress on the virtualization space is going to change we think about applications, operating systems and even debugging.
next step is disallow the slide change until the pdf page is loaded.
alexander larsson is working on gvfs, a new api for accessing files and perform io operations, that whips gnome-vfs' ass in terms of simplicity and portability.
meanwhile, guys on vmware, are making amazing things likethis.
by the way, the clutter api is just beautiful, kudos to the o-hand hackers.

the saddest thing is that it was intentional, someone did it, someone wanted this to happen.
the results of the benchmarks are just impressive.
basically it allows you to show opengl accelerated graphics of applications running in a virtualized guest os like linux.
a forest guard set up the gran canaria south western forest on fire to protest against his job situation, smart move huh?.
