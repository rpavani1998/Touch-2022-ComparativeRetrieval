this can be a way to provide more and more capabilities to applications without requiring them to access extensions directly.sgi's experience (particularly based on sgi's experience with the visual simulation market and iris performer) shows that customers and software developers greatly benefit from higher-level apis to that make optimal use of hardware features.game developers may find opengl optimizer interesting for quickly building game 3d modeling and layout tools, but opengl optimizer is probably not something anyone is going to use as the basis for a game engine.direct3d offers neither the performance or quality to do cad or 3d modeling well.a low-level standard would benefit new application development.there are lots of opportunities to provide optimization value with a scene graph api that aren't available in opengl.we need a lot more input and representation from the user community.much the same way that opengl developed from sgi's experience implementing its predecssor iris gl in conjunction with other opengl arb partners, opengl++ is about designing a standard high-level 3d framework based on sgi's 3d toolkit design experience and working with other interested industry leaders.in the cad market, this means a higher-level api that handles multiprocessing, view frustum culling, occlusion culling, fast picking, excellent surface trimming, use of opengl evalauators, etc. >opengl++ is intended to be the underlying infrastructure on top of which the other three are built.it can be quite frustrating for an application to be locked into access through a higher-level api with no way to do things that the underlying layer could accomplish.still, building good 3d games involves building good 3d tools, and opengl optimzier can help in this area.to promote high-end graphics intensive cad and 3d modeling applications.kurt: sgi's goal is to create an environment in which applications could use a variety of libraries (where opengl provides the common foundation) to accomplish their tasks.therefore there is a rich solution space, and vendors are poised to deliver a variety of solutions.
