autodesk inventor oem is a development platform that allows you to create a stand-alone application built on autodesk inventor technology.
inventor oem gives you precise control of shape characteristics such  as tangency and continuity.
once this application is approved, tech soft 3d will be providing with a contract to review and sign.
control sheet metal unfolding with styles that define the material thickness, bend rules, and corner reliefs.
whereas parametric design allows the capturing of design intent, ilogic design in inventor oem allows the capture of design intelligence and offers the possibility for custom design of standard parts.
hoops exchange easily integrates with other 3d toolkits in the hoops product suite, hoops visualize and hoops publish, to create a complete framework for reading, interrogating and publishing 3d data.
exclude or substitute individual components and make changes to dimension and constraint values.
• reliability and fidelity • available for c++ and .net development (c# to be confirmed) • read/write dwg including read and write support for the autocad 2000-2011 releases (as well as r14), drawing enhancements now available with autocad 2012 and read and write support for visual studio 2010 • read/write dxf r12 and newer as well
construct 3d part geometry from a closed set of surfaces, and incorporate imported surface data into the model using the sculpt tool to modify existing parts by adding or removing material.
ilogic  introduces a design for reuse and automation methodology that is the next  logical step in parametric modeling.

it can be licensed on its own or together with these additional industry-leading toolkits to offer a complete, world-class platform of cooperative engineering software components for your applications development.
the branding is configurable so you can define your own application name,  splash screen, application icons, executable name, etc.
parasolid is built on foundation capabilities that enable it to be deployed successfully in a wide variety of software applications.
built on the industry standard autocad platform, these applications have reliable underlying technology that has been heavily tested both in the lab and on the desktops of millions of users.
using hoops visualize as your graphics platform you can work at a very high level to rapidly implement complex functionality, accelerating your project to a much earlier completion.
verify that your product can be assembled.
by integratinghoops publish into your application, your products can be easily enabled to deliver native-readable 3d pdf documents.
to control the unfolding geometry, inventor software supports linear unfolding, custom unfold equations, and custom bend tables.
developers can flexibly implement and develop powerful adobe pdf solutions in desktop environments as well as a wide range of server platforms.
licensees of hoops visualize are provided with a full developer support service, and can optionally request a priority support service if an even closer level of technical partnership is required.
2d formatsfile format import export additional libraries required hoops visualize provides core and advanced functionality for creating high performance 2d & 3d applications, including: for each tech soft 3d product, licensing and license fees are designed to provide excellent value, helping developers spend their r&d funds efficiently and quickly deliver successful products to market.

parasolid’s foundation capabilities include: in addition to these foundation capabilities there are a wealth of further features available depending on the level ofparasolid licensing selected: communicator, editor or designer.
hoops exchange is the only data access technology based on the open prc format specification, which is progressing towards iso standardization.
whereas parametric design allows the  capturing of design intent, ilogic design in inventor oem allows the capture of  design intelligence and offers the possibility for custom design of standard  parts.
your customers don't need  to know that it is based on inventor since it is installed using your  installer, licensed with your licensing, and is branded as your product  (application name, splash screen, and various other icons), save the  "powered by autodesk inventor" graphic in the zero-document state.

simplify rules-based design with easy-to-use, clickable tools that any  inventor user working at the individual and engineering workgroup level can use  – even those with little or no programming experience.
3d pdf documents produced usinghoops publish can include a range of graphics, data and dynamic interactive 3d content that significantly enriches the communication of intent through the design and manufacturing supply chain.
using the publishing api, software development teams can easily add simple or complex document output capabilities into existing applications.
inventor oem includes the ilogic™ module, which extends and enhances the parametric design capabilities of inventor oem, automates tedious design tasks, and adds higher levels of design intelligence to the production of digital prototypes.
rules can be added to any inventor part or assembly model  transforming it into a reusable knowledge asset.
“the transition of the ttf library to the hoops exchange library, the improvements in the functional content of the hoops exchange technology, and maybe most importantly, the knowledge, expertise and support of the entire tech soft 3d organization has reassured softech that we made the right decision,” jay pappas, productcenter product manager, softech.
ilogic is used to define the product behaviors, using logimetric rules,  that result from changing the design input values.
the sdk includes many features such as: create, edit, fonts, assemble document, compress, security features.
bring dwg compatibility into your application thanks to realdwg ®, the same software libraries used in autocad, autodesk® viz, autocad® revit® and autodesk® inventor®.
provides easy access to powerful design automation functions through a  simple, user-friendly interface designed for users with little or no  programming experience.
to control the unfolding  geometry, inventor software supports linear unfolding, custom unfold equations,  and custom bend tables.
we would be glad to arrange a consultation with a member of our business development team to review your specific project and provide detailed licensing information based on your own requirements.
inventor oem combines an intuitive 3d mechanical design  environment for creating parts and assemblies with specialized design tools  that enable engineers to focus on design function, not geometry creation.
