as far as the game's ai, its scripting is specific to egoboo.
"if anyone reading this ever writes a graphic program, wrap the graphics api calls in macros!" ben points out that opengl itself was not the problem in this process: "opengl has been a pleasure to work with.

the original code from direct3d  was a complete mess.

they don't rotate properly."
" the egoboo project could also use contributions of character and object  models for the game and definitely needs more level maps.
other  map-making tools for egoboo are also available and in development, including egomap, which adds random level generation to the game.
while the game looks  very good in its current form, it does not have a polished feel of a commercial  game, which ben admits and wants to see improved.
"converting direct3d to opengl was like getting teeth pulled,"  describes ben.
in something like a real-time strategy, you might not notice if your units take a half-second to start moving.
another partial feature is transparency.
figure 3 -- a little lightning before any new features can be added to egoboo's game play, ben says a couple of existing technical issues need to be addressed, particularly with its graphics.
" in the end, ben is proudest not of the technical achievements that he, his  brother, and various volunteers have made to egoboo, but, rather, the game's  very place within the overall open source gaming scene.
some have suggested to the egoboo developers that they uselua for scripting the ai functions, but there has been no significant progress on this idea.
ben, who wrote some of the ai, feels this is unfortunate because it has probably hindered further development by others who might want to help to improve it.

"being an action game, network code timing is a big concern.
the creators ofegoboo--brothers aaron and ben bishop--have aimed to make their game the most accessible and cutest open source dungeon rpg.
egoboo features real-time action and 3d graphics.
"converting direct3d to opengl was like getting teeth pulled," describes ben.
aside from the opengl and sdl apis, the rest of the codebase is original and was written in c by the bishop brothers.
egoboo is also supposed to have a network play feature, but it's broken in its present state.
fixing the particle graphics is easy, says ben, but the network issue will be tougher to resolve.
they also credit other open source programmers specializing in graphics for  contributing the help they needed to accomplish this specific task.

they don't rotate  properly."
ben says this may partly be because support for the lua language in egoboo "is not 'fully baked' as of now, from what i know."
both brothers currently reside in danville, pennsylvania.

the networking challenge is typical for this type of game.
on egoboo, this is not the case," says ben.

ben eventually convinced his brother to release it as open source.

"our main problem is that we haven't gotten around to porting the network code from the original directx. i think it would be a pretty straightforward job for a competent programmer with some spare time.
the game runs under linux, windows, and mac os x. egoboo was originally developed by aaron bishop.
in fact, ben says his brother has already developed some of his own: "aaron always seemed to get distracted and [would] code up new games using the egoboo engine.
the world of bishopia consists of seven  environments.
they then rewrote egoboo for cross-platform portability by usingsdl and opengl.
other  kinds of games can be built upon it.
