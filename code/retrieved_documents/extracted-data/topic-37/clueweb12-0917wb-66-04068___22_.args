such constant performance advances are strong evidence that not only hardware, but software will continue its accelerating ability to deliver simulated reality.as image recognition improves, such networks will allow a virtual realtime map of city auto and foot traffic, a major advance for secure cities.2d visual interfaces will remain a more efficient solution than 3d for many applications.2d online collaboration environments, like webex, could continue to be more efficient than anything we can create in 3d. 3d videoconferencing, which is easily available in many work environments, is used today only for special occasions, such as meetings.we apologize for any mistakes or misrepresentations, and hope you enjoy this rich source of community insight relevant to the future of the 3d-enabled web.this, in combination with the accelerating popularity of our larger online worlds, allows for the accumulation of significant physical world income from virtual world activities.this will allow users of portable and wearable electronics to recharge while waiting, eliminating one of the major problems with current portability of the 3d web.this is a development with global implications, as it promises to eliminate the current sensory opportunity cost of spending extended time in virtual environments.1d (text) and 2d are faster and more user-friendly for many types of interactions, both with data and with other people.this has allowed successively more computing-intensive performance thresholds (desktop publishing, 3d graphics, pda's etc.) to be crossed for mass market ict devices.this presently allows rapid web browsing, very light streaming video and audio to the mobile user, and dedicated voip.further developments will show if these growth rates continue to hold, but as we continually learn new ways to represent, locally store, and generate data, these growth constants seem a reasonable expectation for many classes of visual, sensory, and system simulation.ipv6â€™s mandatory security, (authentication and non-repudiation), auto-configuration, multiple options for communication (unicast, multicast, broadcast, anycast), logical group indexing for addresses, and 128 bit address space (10^23 addresses per square meter of planet surface area) should be sufficient for all global embedded devices for the foreseeable future.but perhaps a more competitive future will be the ability to run professional cad/cam, architecture, plm and other simulation software from within virtual worlds, as specialized creation environments for those with prototyping interests.vp systems "automate the exploration of the design space", allowing designers to try different materials and design parameters, rapidly simulating the physical and cost characteristics of the expected result.
