while this sounds complicated, it's actually quite simple.
what it wants to see is: messagebox (hwnd, text("this is my first ce app"), text("hello world"), mb_ok); the text-macro simply converts a string at compile-time to unicode format.

there are plenty of disadvantages, though, to this  approach.
while some extensions like winsock are still around (supporting ir communication, cool eh?), many of the latter-day add-ons to windows are nowhere to be found.
best of all, though, is that it addresses a problem caused by the loss of directsound -- wave mixing.
in addition to framebuffer access, gapi gives you a relatively  platform-neutral way of accessing the pocketpc's controls.

in fact, they're almost identical to their windows-only brethren, visual c++ 6.0 and visual basic 6.0.
if you want to change the  bits, you need to create a new bitmap, which make it far less than optimal for  displaying frames of animation.
as you can see, the pocketpc machines are all more expensive than the palms, but the capabilities of the pocketpc's are disproportionately greater.
there a couple of game-related technologies  available that will help you ease the pain of working for the platform.

createfont() is gone, but  createfontindirect() is still there.
using createdibsection(), you can create a buffer of memory that's shared between the application and video driver.
embedded visual c++ works through ms's activesync software, which is the software used to connect your pocketpc to your computer to exchange data with your address book and calendar.
this is important  because while some handhelds like the casio and the ipaq have nice little  direction-pads, some like the new hp pocketpc decided to clone
in addition to graphics, ceanim includes a library of common data structures and memory management functions.
ceanim is an extensive class library for windows ce by random software (www.randomly.com).
another problem with gapi is that direct framebuffer access  precludes all of the nice window commands.
from time to time, though,  you'll need to compile on the device so you can ensure that the graphics look  right, the game is playing at a reasonable speed, and no bugs are creeping in  that aren't showing up on the emulator.
furthermore, your emulated app will likely be running much faster emulated than on the device, so you won't get a good feel for how your game plays if you develop solely for the emulator.
this article is going to explore what exactly is windows ce, what this pocketpc thing is, some of the technical aspects that make it the finest platform for handheld gaming available today, and how to get started developing for one.
examine a variable in memory, and visual c++ will get the value and  show it to you on your main screen.
it's without-a-doubt the fastest way to throw pixels on the screen, but it's got a couple of drawbacks.
the start menu was moved to a little icon in the corner.
since there weren't going to be any old ce apps, the designers went through the win32 api with a fine-toothed comb to prune it down to its bare essentials -- a library that would still allow you to create powerful apps, but without supporting a lot of antiquated function calls.
every year a  new version comes out with new capabilities, some of which supercede existing  capabilities.
while there are gapi dll's available for casio,  compaq, and hp, there aren't any such dll's available for other models or  form-factors, and you're beholden to microsoft if any new pocketpc models come  out.
while gapi's strengths are that it is very simple and does the job it sets out to do, it has a couple of weaknesses.
you can change the bits as necessary and blit the buffer to the screen very quickly using the standard old bitblt() command.
if you want to change the bits, you need to create a new bitmap, which make it far less than optimal for displaying frames of animation.

and there are a few technologies that will help you develop games that rival what you see on the desktop.
in fact, the api functions that aren't part of the kernel, window, and gdi modules of windows probably aren't there.
just be prepared, when developing a pocketpc app, to hunt for updated versions of some of your favorite api functions.
pressing the "run" button will then run your app in the on-screen windows ce emulator.
not only are  there some very capable developer tools for pocketpc, they're available for a  song.
for one, you're compiling for a processor that simply doesn't exist in the pocketpc world.

also, the  emulator takes on the capabilities of the compiling machine, so you'll likely  be developing your app on a 24-bit screen even though there are no pocketpc's  with 24-bit screens.
tha palm's horrible four-horizontal-keys layout.
much like microsoft's unsuccessful plans for windows nt running on every desktop platform, you can write to a standard windows api and get your application to work on all ce processors with a simple recompile.
windows ce running on a p/pc about a year ago, microsoft released a new version of the windows ce interface, redubbed "pocketpc".
despite the technical superiority of hardware like the casio e-100 series, the palm-size pc platform was savaged by critics for being overcomplicated and clumsy to use.
don't despair, though.
a significant chunk of the win32 api functions (around 90%  of 'em, actually) aren't there.
drawtext() was better than textout(), so  drawtext() got to stay.
finally, the emulator only runs on windows nt or windows 2000 for reasons that will be clear later.
there are some facts, though, that you might not know. . .
since there weren't going to be any  old ce apps, the designers went through the win32 api with a fine-toothed comb  to prune it down to its bare essentials -- a library that would still allow you  to create powerful apps, but without supporting a lot of antiquated function  calls.
how the compiler works there are two ways to develop an app for pocketpc, and you will very likely be using both methods interchangeably.
thankfully, switching between one approach and another is as simple as choosing the target processor on the toolbar and recompiling.
just kiss the venerable old char * goodbye.

thankfully, though, you don't have to worry about what processor for which you're writing.
since unicode is the way of the world, and supporting both ansi and unicode would take up more space than necessary, ansi strings got the boot.
using createdibsection(), you  can create a buffer of memory that's shared between the application and video  driver.
the pocketpc api is different from the win32 api sorry to throw a bucket of cold water on your plans, but if you have grand designs on simply recompiling your code and having it work, it's not going to happen that easily.
the first is by compiling your  game for a connected device, then uploading, running, and debugging the game  over the connection (usually serial).
for the bulk of development, the on-screen emulator is the way to go.
in addition to framebuffer access, gapi gives you a relatively platform-neutral way of accessing the pocketpc's controls.

if you don't need to throw pixels at the screen at the highest speed possible, and you want very good speed without worrying about what new platforms are coming out and whether or not gapi will support them, you should look at the win32 dibsection api.
also shown are a couple of popular palm devices for comparison.
there's a sound class that can play multiple sounds at once so you don't have to cripple the sounds in your game.
all of the  pocketpc functions that take strings are expecting unicode strings.
to compile for the emulator, you set the target processor as the x86 ce emulator, press the "make" button, and embedded visual c++ will generate a windows ce app that runs on the x86 processor.
while there are gapi dll's available for casio, compaq, and hp, there aren't any such dll's available for other models or form-factors, and you're beholden to microsoft if any new pocketpc models come out.
hey, where's globalalloc?
createfont() is gone, but createfontindirect() is still there.

while it may look more or less like plain old windows , it is a completely different animal from windows 3.x, windows 9x, and windows nt.
calling it  an emulator, though, is a bit of a misnomer.

the dibsection api and ceanim
the biggest difference is that they do not generate native x86 windows  applications.

the second method is to develop for the on-screen pocketpc emulator.
rather than make  processor-emulators for the various processors out there, ms simply built a  version of windows ce that runs on an x86 processor.
the doom and quake engines direct3d and opengl don't exist for pocketpc, but you're not out of luck if you're looking for 3d that fits in your pocket.
the device and embedded visual c++ are constantly having to  update each other as to the status of your running program.
it's been around since windows 95, and it works.
this goes for every hard-coded string in your application, from  window-class-names to filenames you pass to the file-handling commands.
it's a great way to get your app up and running quickly, and debugging is a breeze.
just be prepared, when developing a  pocketpc app, to hunt for updated versions of some of your favorite api  functions.
using the on-screen emulator, you can run an application under the debugger and it will run just as quickly as if you were debugging a native windows application.
the designers of ce decided early on to focus on portability and small size in the design of ce, and it shows.
if you need a form-based data-collector or something to perform field calculations for you, it's ideal.
both doom and quake 1 have  been ported to pocketpc, and you can use them to develop your own projects.
ddb's (device dependent bitmaps) are owned by the video driver and are in whatever format the driver prefers.
the principal advantage to this approach is speed.
if you  don't need to throw pixels at the screen at the highest speed possible, and you  want very good speed without worrying about what new platforms are coming out  and whether or not gapi will support them, you should look at the win32  dibsection api.
it's certainly worth a look.

if anything, check out the author's ce offerings at the web address above to see the kind of things you can do.
the biggest difference is that they do not generate native x86 windows applications.
set a breakpoint in your code, and the code will stop when it gets to that point.
if you  have windows 95/98/me, you're stuck with developing on the connected device.
it's a great way to get your app up  and running quickly, and debugging is a breeze.
another problem with gapi is that direct framebuffer access precludes all of the nice window commands.
the standard windows interface, while it worked well on larger screens, was tight on handhelds and was downright difficult on a small 240x320 screen.

dibsections are weird birds.
you could modify the  bits directly, and you could display them to the screen quickly.

if you want to draw a line, some text, or stretch a bitmap, you're on your own.
the pitch values specify the distance between pixel values in the  buffer, because a framebuffer is not necessarily a 240x320 array of 16-bit  values.
