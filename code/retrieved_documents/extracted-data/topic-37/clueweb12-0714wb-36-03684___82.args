there's no reason windows 2000 pro wasn't sufficient to run today's modern games if they had just released the latest directx libraries for it, but then they wouldn't have sold windows xp and dragged gamers into the wonderful world of drm and activation.
" some of us find it amazingly funny that anyone gives any software company the benefit of the doubt, at least with their own money.
4xaa is a compulsory that would seem to me to be the biggest change, that it requires batteries now.
running at a lower resolution than native will add scaling artefacts, and aa can make these even worse.
directx 10 other than a few limp patches and demos does not exist, hardware accelerated physics nope not yet, sli or dual and quad gpu's hardly give a return on the investment unless you are running multiple monitors, etc etc etc.
by requiring the hardware to support to be '10.1 compatible' they are merely pandering to the majority of gamers out there.
so we would never know.
and it will auto tune the speakers and environment sounds for an outstanding experience.
more ammo to windows/directx monopoly which effects everything.
if you are an early adopter of the latest hardware and don't read any reviews (which all from memory said it will be some time before dx10 is going to matter) then thats your fault.
of course, we're seeing this news on the inquirer, often considered to be a slightly less-than-reliable source of tech news.
as result they are bound to directx policies by msft.
dx 10 being only on vista was based on a very valid techical reason... that they gave up on and removed.
(score:2, interesting) by bomanbot(980297) writes: developers already have difficulties justifiying directx 10 support because vista marketshare is still so low and most gamers are perfectly fine with xp and directx 9.
so why valve did that at that time i'll never understand, but microsoft understood the market in this case, all too well.
this is especially true on displays like lcds, which have a fixed pixel size.
from the sdl website: simple directmedia layer is a cross-platform multimedia library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, 3d hardware via opengl, and 2d video framebuffer.

from http://www.gamesforwindows.com/en-us/aboutgfw/pag e s/directx10.aspx [gamesforwindows.com] : directx® apis gives multimedia applications access to the advanced features of high-performance hardware such as three-dimensional (3-d) graphics acceleration chips and sound cards.
the extra price of opengl comes not from "the fact they are intended for real developers" (whatever that means), but rather from the fact that it's not
(better hardware to improve fps while trying to keep aa/af or hdr at a maximum.)

graphics card features change all the time, you have to write miles of caps checking code and render paths to support the zoo of cards and features.
a hybrid seems the way to go: rasterizing by default, but the ability to shoot rays in the pixel shader, which would be extremely cool for reflections and refractions.
you think that "linux user" wouldn't have clue but you forget wine factor.
developers are going to say "ok, everyone better upgrade because this is all we support!"
we like our hardware powerful.
a fixed feature set is what allows developers to squeze out every drop of performance from ps2 hardware to make amazing looking graphics, even though your mobile phone might have more processing power available to it.

you also face the issue that, traditionally, most graphics cards have been optimized for directx, since that's what the lion's share of the market uses.
if anything ships saying "intel only" , you will get a clue since there are very powerful ppc (e.g. g5 dual core) macs out there so cpu "speed" can't be an excuse.
this is why dx 10 could only run on vista.

i wound up replacing my entire pc in order to save money.
i can't see any reason why game development should not be point and click, if they made something like opengl easier to write for, i think it would be a positive for the game market, - re: (score:3, interesting) by ilgaz (86384)
if i wrote a blog article "rules for wiping ones arse" that would be a standard.
the thing ms changed to in vista for the sound was what xbox is using... thus making it easier to port back and forth.
i guess my dx9 card has beenobsolete for a few years now, it still ticks on nicely though.
they control low- level functions, including two- dimensional (2-d) graphics acceleration; support for input devices such as joysticks, keyboards, and mice; and control of sound mixing and sound output.
at last resort, your opengl layer would "software render" the opengl 3 content instead of telling gpu to draw it."
unles - you can tell microsoft is ignoring customers....
if games are easier to write (skipping over the effectiveness/perceived effectiveness of any 'platform'), then there are more people writing games and becoming developers, which would make the game market more competitive, and thusly we would have better games!
recently i upgraded to windows vista by microsoft in order to play their newest game "shadowrun".
it's a bitlate [elitebastards.com] for people to be in shock about it.
they use directx for the directinput and directsound apis, i believe.
game developers are finding shader 3.0 (directx 9.0c) gives them more than enough to do.

since microsoft decided to drop efi support from vista, pretty much the only graphics cards that support efi are the ones that ship with macs anyway.
even putting the same speakers on a mac and 'trying' get the fidelity up, the sound quality was not even close to what vista was doing with an old sound card.
if it can't, that's where the fear comes in.
this was a serious investment, the video card alone put me back about the price of a new "non-gaming" pc.
journal on many games, i can run at a much higher resolution without aa than with.
