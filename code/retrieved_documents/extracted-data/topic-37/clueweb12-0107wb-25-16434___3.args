it was in my mind to write the stuff offline and then uploading it, but there wasn't any very important news - and the weather was fine.
i will not bother you with very outdated news - only the fresh new stuff - plus the noteworthly things noname didn't broadcast.
i'm going to a birthday party this eve, so there will not be any updates tonight.
the week was filled up with sun, sun and sun.
after some abortive tries, we found a strange and big hotel.
if you have any contests you would like us to list, pleasee-mail joshua the contest details.
it's not quake 1 nor quake 2, but does nod it's head in the direction of the online dm version of both those products (and apparently pissing off both parties at the same time).
the test version of this multiplayer-only game is available as an update to the 1.06 version noname mentionedlast week, or as a full 30mb installer from scratch.
note that this version is available as a win32 client and server, in addition to a linux client.
his father and himself made wines (what else to do?), and of course we tasted and buyed the great-tasting wine (henri gross).
look to the next id product to give you the "brand new" gameplay and world.
[saturday 24 july 1999 - 13:05 cet - cosmo] peter told me that gt interactive has updated theirunreal tournament level of the week page.
when on the subject, i can tell you that id software's graeme "zaphod" devine has made a.plan update: 1.07 is out there.
the big complication we've faced porting unreal tournament is that our c++ code needed lots of modifications for gnu c++, but since that's the playstation's compiler too, our code should be linux-friendly all along.
he kept the site alive while i was away, although he messed up the news-archiveing stuff and was on a little vacation himself.
then, we said goodbye to our dear friends and travelling-buddies, heading forward to lühneburg in germany.

i have had two wonderful weeks in france and a bunch of other cool countries in europe.
user created art will show up as either all black or black and white or as other funky looking combos... basically totally wrong.
and just kick my balls for the archiveing-thing, it is i that should make a news-updating script soon.
i will not bother you with very outdated news - only the fresh new stuff - plus the noteworthly things noname didn't broadcast.
update: anyway, i'll not accomplish this post today, simply because i do not have the time, and most of the news are outdated anyway...
so i just downloaded winamp and played some music...
i can't promise linux, but it would be pretty easy i think.
there was a bit trouble with some insurance-stuff, but the light was fine after ½-hour with a funny cheap price.
when my tnt2 ultra arrives in a week or so, i will update the screenshots section with more shots from various 3d games.
after some abortive tries, we found a strange and big hotel.
d3d clearly has better quality drivers on the pc, and opengl is the api of choice for portability to non-pc platforms.
so i just downloaded winamp and played some music...
when i was going to update some days later, the thinkpad went boom-bang for the first time since april - i think it is some ram-related problems.
that wasn't that weird anymore when we found out that the whole port was moved higher up in the mountains because the biggest, fake lake was made in the bottom!
also take a look at thequake2 screenshots page, with 6 screenshots taken with a ati rage fury 128 in 1024x768 by jarle kaste.
they are also giving away the new version of the intensor chair, details ontheir contests page.
we bathed, ate, watched some dvd's, went on bowling, mini-golf, a big theme park and tons of more.
and the weather was constantly around 40¤c. after a wonderful week, we went into italy, with some pretty impressive bridges and tunnels.
user created art will show up as either all black or black and white or as other funky looking combos... basically totally wrong.
but norwegians still knows the art of tunnel and bridge-making!
we spent the night in a nice hotel in a weird town with very simular houses.

we spent the night on a old and cosy hotel, before we used the car some hours, arriving in a town near the port-town hirtshals.
in addition to myself of course, my nearest family (my dad, mom and little brother), and some close frieds (ragnar bø - the mandatum chief monkey, his wife and two daughters) fired up our audis and took the ferry from oslo to kiel.

and a faster server too (a new server is here, but not set up first).
there's a lot in the test which is very temporary, so while we've taken great pride in putting out very solid test releases, we're still working hard on the final product and very much appreciate your feedback (q3feedback@idsoftware.com) in getting this product right for you - the players -
quake 3 arena will keep basically with what you've seen and read about up until now and it's now time to put this one to bed.
we did a little shopping and went to the zoo before we (and the cars) took the night-train to basel, and drove stright through switzerland.
and a faster server too (a new server is here, but not set up first).
check the news archive and quake3 test section onblue's news if you want more tips and tweaks for improving your performance, and grab the files fromthe official q3test site.
thedrivers section is also updated with the latest driver database from driverzone.
the new version fixes some cheating bugs, hopefully fixes some server problems, and should generally play much better than the previous releases.
my sweet compaq palmtop didn't want to surf at all, i will try to fix it in the next days.

i had a ibm thinkpad with a 9600 modem, but being on the net with a cellular phone, calling from france to norway - is _very_ expensive.

the specific problem is with user created art (reticles, skins, etc.) and voodoo configurations with more than one tmu.
it was in my mind to write the stuff offline and then uploading it, but there wasn't any very important news - and the weather was fine.
