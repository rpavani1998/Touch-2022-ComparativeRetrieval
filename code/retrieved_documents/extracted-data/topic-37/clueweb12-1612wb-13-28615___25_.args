from time to time, though, you'll need to compile on the device so you can ensure that the graphics look right, the game is playing at a reasonable speed, and no bugs are creeping in that aren't showing up on the emulator.the development tools are robust and very inexpensive.developing an app for the on-screen emulator will make you feel right at home if you're used to developing standard windows apps under visual c++ 6.0.the tools are very mature and robust.it leverages the dibsection api to the hilt to provide all kinds of animation effects, including sprite animation, alpha blending, dirty rectangle management, and palette management.the standard windows interface, while it worked well on larger screens, was tight on handhelds and was downright difficult on a small 240x320 screen.it's a great way to get your app up and running quickly, and debugging is a breeze.you could modify the bits directly, and you could display them to the screen quickly.since embedded visual basic produces programs that are interpreted by the pocketpc's rather rudimentary vbscript interpreter, embedded visual basic isn't really suitable for games.using the on-screen emulator, you can run an application under the debugger and it will run just as quickly as if you were debugging a native windows application.the c++ compiler cross-compiles to the aforementioned processors, while embedded visual basic produces files that are interpreted by a vbscript-style interpreter on the target device.a dib's memory is owned by your application, but drawing the bitmap to the screen requires the video driver to convert the bitmap to screen format, which makes displaying them much slower than ddb's.while internally it was basically the same windows ce as the earlier versions, the user-interface was retooled to work better on a tiny screen.furthermore, your emulated app will likely be running much faster emulated than on the device, so you won't get a good feel for how your game plays if you develop solely for the emulator.they are very fast to display but have one gigantic drawback -- you can't change the bits once you've created the bitmap.
