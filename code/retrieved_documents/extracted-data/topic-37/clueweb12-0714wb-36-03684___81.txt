perhaps because of this many people bought in to the dx10 cards expecting them to be "futureproof".
there is alot of money needed to develop for all three api's, if your company can afford it, then good for you.
if anyone really wants to understand the audio in vista, do a search on vista audio subsystem, or sonar vista.
they listen to the api fixes and new features that game developers ask them for, and they work with graphics card manufacturers to expose new capabilities as soon as they are available, and release new directx sdks every few months.
i wound up replacing my entire pc in order to save money.
the reason is that there are still a lot of people using older cards.
this doesn't mean your dx10 card doesn't work anymore, you don't install sp1 and your pc wont boot with dx10 hardware.
i am sure lots of game developers who coded direct3d only stuff questioned their choice and started to look to recent opengl advancements.
intel brings out a new processor every x months with ~1-3% improvements, by your logic they should just stop bothering making new processors.
d3d10.1 would be fine if it had new actual features.
which is why a lot of older titles have issues in the software emulation version of directsound in vista.
exactly the cleanest api at the moment (but that will change in a few months when opengl 3.0 finally hits).

just because microsoft officially announced it at a conference doesn't *exactly* make it new news, since they made it very clear on roadmaps and everything else exactly what was going to happen, and why it wasn't the best idea ever to adopt directx 10.0 hardware, rather than hardware capable of 10.1 (or 10.2) and whatever the new superset of opengl happened to be (3.0 as it turns out).

if anything ships saying "intel only" , you will get a clue since there are very powerful ppc (e.g. g5 dual core) macs out there so cpu "speed" can't be an excuse.

so the choice to go opengl instead of direct3d also means that a bunch of gamers will post "omg, your game has crap frame rates" or "omg, your game doesn't work on my computer."

i'd just hope that eventually, there's more actual competition again, and both companies (and new companies) actually respect and care about standards compliance and that both they and the standards bodies start to care about what customers actually doing with their hardware.
and dx10.1 adds back in directx level apis for game developers.
they control low- level functions, including two- dimensional (2-d) graphics acceleration; support for input devices such as joysticks, keyboards, and mice; and control of sound mixing and sound output.

i read a post a while back where someone who was in the know explained it (it was on one of the microsoft blogs, i think).
unplug out brain from the marketing driven fanboy/hater game and just enjoy ride.
ogl provides the raw basics of graphics, be it 2d or 3d, while direct-x can be thought of as ogl bundled with apis that help reduce doing some of the common stuff.
i don't know, it's been years since i've followed "hardcore" games and specs.
i see no reason why games companies can't support more than one at a time.
but i criticized the ps3 mainly because linux has not access to the whole hardware, the lack of ram expansion options, the braindead hd partition scheme.

maybe i'll reserve judgement until i hear another explanation from some other source.
another note to self, until hardware is "mainstream" no developers are going to invest huge amounts of time or resources on it... thus the slight difference between dx9 and dx10.

well, you entirely missed the point... directx is primarily a games-oriented technology, and the graphics cards this issue affects will be mostly expensive, leading-edge ones.
if you'll run "dxdiag", you'll see that it has more tabs and more dlls listed than just direct3d and directdraw.
it's not any of being "busier", it's an issue of money.

things such as no surround support, only stereo, sound not working properly, etc. openal titles work fine though.
running at a lower resolution than native will add scaling artefacts, and aa can make these even worse.
graphics and computing power is fabulous compared to what it was just a few years ago, and the fact that ms has set an actual standard is kick ass
is it easier to program for?
that stuff doesn't cause major programming difficulties and in any case third-party libraries (such as miles in the case of sound) do it better and are more portable than microsoft's stuff.
it'll just take a few years to become the standard.

by requiring the hardware to support to be '10.1 compatible' they are merely pandering to the majority of gamers out there.
the game itself required the best video card i could afford.
at last resort, your opengl layer would "software render" the opengl 3 content instead of telling gpu to draw it.
i see same attitude on os x only users, instead of pushing apple to fix their issues they go and actually purchase windows xp to run via boot camp.
homepage seriously.. the new imac is fun to use an you can put behind microsoft's psychotic mood swings on its standards forever.
sadly though, sound is one area vista gets no credit, yet is one of the best selling points of vista.

microsoft has completely eliminated the capability bits, or "capbits", concept in order to ensure to developers that if they program a specific version of the standard that all of the functionality mandatory by that standard will be supported by the graphics hardware.
