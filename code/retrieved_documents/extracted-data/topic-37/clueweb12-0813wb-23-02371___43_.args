microsoft is the only vendor out there with the breadth to give developers an integrated solution across the whole spectrum from ui graphics, to customizable services, to sql spatial tables.the ability to link many services into a solution chain is one of the dreams come true of web development and one reason why web applications continue to supersede the desktop world.future mobile devices could potentially take advantage of the human body’s bi-lateral symmetry.two hand vector controlling for 3d scenes is also promising and integrates very well with sl5 xna immediate mode graphics.even though technically possible, and simple to implement in silverlight, such distractions do nothing to make the ui endearing.microsoft’s wcf is a nice framework especially since it leverages the same c# language, ide, and debugging capabilities across all tiers of a solution.web mapping adds an element of exploration, with zoom and pan flight through these abstract spaces, that mirrors movement in our physical world.with highly dynamic data, tiles can be built on the fly but with consequent loss of performance as well as loading on the server that affects scaling.although you pick up recursive control rendering with xml 3d, you lose out when it comes to moving through a scene in the usual avatar game sense.as browser market fragmentation and mobile devices force adoption of standards based technologies, proprietary plugins are just not making the transition, at least for public facing web apps.performance isn’t as good as a static tile pyramid, but it isn’t bad and simplifies life immensely.homogenous geographic data density works best with hard zoom level switches.for one thing too many points clutter a map, while their simplicity means that more point vectors can be rendered before affecting ui performance.microsoft’s full range single vendor package is obviously a powerful incentive in the enterprise world.it even illustrates the use of a normal (bump) map for 3d effects on the surface without needing a tessellated surface terrain model.
