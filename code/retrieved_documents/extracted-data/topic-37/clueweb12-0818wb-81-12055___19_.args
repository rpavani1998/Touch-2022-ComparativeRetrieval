binary components have full access to the application and os, and so can impact stability, security, and performance.keeping as much of add-on code in javascript reduces the impact of internal changes to firefox, and allows for much easier maintainability.when paired with high-performance javascript, such as what we’ve seen come from both firefox and other browsers, should allow for some exciting fully 3d-enabled web applications.this has many advantages for users: they can see that additional functionality is installed in the add-ons manager, and from there they can easily enable or disable it, as well as check for and receive updates.in addition, by keeping it as bare-bones as it is, it allows for fast implementation on native hardware via the jits in all the current-generation js engines.(mac os x users shouldn’t need to bother with software rendering, since apple already provides a high quality opengl implementation, and linux users should be ok as long as they have recent opengl drivers installed.)even more complicated is the need to manage multiple types within a single memory region; for performance, it’s often preferable to allocate one chunk of video memory, and place coordinates, colors, and other types in there, replacing them as necessary.having this version information allows for safe upgrades, especially when binary components are present.this avoids placing costly js array type conversion in a potential critical performance path, and simplifies a number of aspects of the api.because a number of internal interfaces changed between the two versions, this leads to crashes or other problems when these components are used.in particular, creating binary components to interface with the os or with other applications is fairly straightforward, though ultimately dangerous.it became clear that pure js arrays are not a useful way of shoveling around lots of 3d data; their very flexibility makes them impractical for performance-critical uses.for those of you on windows who don’t have an up to date opengl driver, or don’t have the possibility of getting one (e.g. many common intel graphics cards doesn’t have opengl drivers), you can enable software rendering by downloading a windows build of the mesa software opengl implementation.in order to simplify future integration with native code, firefox 3.6 will include support forjsctypes for add-on developers.also, critically, floating point data can be stored as 32-bit single-precision floats instead of 64-bit doubles, taking up half as much space when the underlying graphics system can’t support 64-bit values.
