ben eventually convinced his brother to release it as open source.
he invites others to  contribute to egoboo's development; outside submissions of any sort will  encourage the release of more official updates to the game: "it takes some effort to put a new release out.

ben, who  wrote some of the ai, feels this is unfortunate because it has probably  hindered further development by others who might want to help to improve it.

other  map-making tools for egoboo are also available and in development, including egomap, which adds random level generation to the game.

ben says this may partly be because support for the lua language in egoboo "is not 'fully baked' as of now, from what i know."
"converting direct3d to opengl was like getting teeth pulled,"  describes ben.

the networking challenge is typical for this type of game.
it is possible for others to study the existing ai scripts and documentation, but he admits it is not easy to figure out.
aside from the opengl and sdl apis, the rest of the codebase is original  and was written in c by the bishop brothers.
they then rewrote egoboo for cross-platform portability by usingsdl and opengl.
