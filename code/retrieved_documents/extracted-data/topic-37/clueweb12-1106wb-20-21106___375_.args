they provide closer integration (e.g. mouse pointer, time synchronization), improve the interactive performance (e.g. better video support), and allow to share data through shared folders between the host system and the virtual machine.it can be used to access remote sites, make secure point to point connnections, enhance wifi security, etc. .by using dynamic translation it achieves reasonable speed while being easy to port on new host cpus.bacula is relatively easy to use and efficient, while offering many advanced storage management features that make it easy to find and recover lost or damaged files.it enables easier testing and debugging of system code.it provides a convenient interface for software developers to include standards-compliant id3v1/2 tagging capabilities in their applications.it aims at seamless user interface and ease of use, providing generally smoother user experience than the "raw" core git itself and indeed many other version control systems.compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but the generated programs deliver excellent performance, while retaining the moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler.this compiler runs quickly, generates compact code with moderate memory requirements, and is portable to essentially any 32 or 64 bit unix platform.it allows for transparent switching between between all supported interfaces, allowing it to tie together a diverse mixture of telephony systems into a single switching network. .it combines ease of use, contemporary functionality, and outstanding graphical design with the technological superiority of the unix operating system. .it provides basic mechanisms for setting up and shutting down connections, for performing authentication, for negotiating versions, and for reporting errors.the package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon in the clamav-daemon package, a commandline scanner in the clamav package, and a tool for automatic updating via internet through the clamav-freshclam package.it tries very hard to handle all error conditions and verify that all data is valid, making it nearly impossible to crash.furthermore, lemon implements features that can be used to eliminate resource leaks, making is suitable for use in long-running programs such as graphical user interfaces or embedded controllers.
