this allows you near full use of windows functions for debugging, though there can be problems with the 3dfx not knowing it's screen/window is visible (another dreaded black screen problem).
opengl as a rasterization only api ---------------------------------------------------------------------- subject 4.01: why use opengl as a rasterization-only api?
in a windows application where you already know the screen resolution you can simply use the following code snippet: hwnd =
in a windows application where you  already know the screen resolution you can simply use the following code  snippet: hwnd = createwindow(szappname, "some name", ws_popup |  ws_clipsiblings, 0, 0, width, height, null, null, hinstance, null); if you  don't know the screen resolution you can use the following code to get it from  the os and then call the above code to create a full screen window: height =
for these reasons it's probably best to use glvertex4f() and supply the transformed (i.e. non unity)
picking/selection | 7.01: how do i use opengl's selection buffer? | 7.02: what are some other methods for picking/selection?
many people are  tempted to use directdraw to switch resolutions under windows, but this can  cause problems with a few of the opengl drivers.

you would also be put into software, or the creation of the context may fail if you request a 24 bit frame buffer on the same card.
something  like: glmatrixmode(gl_projection); glloadidentity();  glmatrixmode(gl_modelview); glloadidentity(); glviewport(0, 0, width, height);  /* viewport size in pixels */ will mean that the 3d point (0,0,0) is in the  center of the viewport, and that (1,1,0) is the top-right corner of the  viewport.

in the future, a joint venture between microsoft and sgi will probably provide a successor to both direct3d and opengl, called fahrenheit.
most likely you have requested a pixel format that is unsupported by your current driver or the requested format cannot fit in the video memory of your card.
if you use opengl to do the transforms for your collision detection or other things you will need to use the feedback mechanism to get the transformed values back into your code.

clear the frame/depth buffers.
in pseudocode, you change this: if (primitive isn't rejected) if (primitive is trivially accepted) draw it else clip it to this: if (primitive isn't rejected) draw it.

a mouse pointer is simply a 2d overlay, and can be drawn with a texture mapped quad (see subject 9.01 and 9.02), or as flat shaded triangles as in the sample below.
