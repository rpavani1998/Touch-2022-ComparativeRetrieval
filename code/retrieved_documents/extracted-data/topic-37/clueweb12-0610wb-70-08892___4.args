as far as the game's ai, its scripting is specific to egoboo.
"if anyone reading this ever writes a graphic program, wrap the graphics api calls in macros!" ben points out that opengl itself was not the problem in this process: "opengl has been a pleasure to work with.
the original code from direct3d was a complete mess.
they did borrow the quake ii model format for game characters, however, to avoid the work of writing their own modeling program from scratch.
they don't rotate properly."
" the egoboo project could also use contributions of character and object models for the game and definitely needs more level maps.
other map-making tools for egoboo are also available and in development, including egomap, which adds random level generation to the game.
while the game looks very good in its current form, it does not have a polished feel of a commercial game, which ben admits and wants to see improved.
"converting direct3d to opengl was like getting teeth pulled," describes ben.
in something like a real-time strategy, you might not notice if your units take a half-second to start moving.
" in the end, ben is proudest not of the technical achievements that he, his brother, and various volunteers have made to egoboo, but, rather, the game's very place within the overall open source gaming scene.
ben, who wrote some of the ai, feels this is unfortunate because it has probably hindered further development by others who might want to help to improve it.

the creators ofegoboo--brothers aaron and ben bishop--have aimed to make their game the most accessible and cutest open source dungeon rpg.
egoboo features real-time action and 3d graphics.
"converting direct3d to opengl was like getting teeth pulled," describes ben.
aside from the opengl and sdl apis, the rest of the codebase is original and was written in c by the bishop brothers.
fixing the particle graphics is easy, says ben, but the network issue will be tougher to resolve.
they also credit other open source programmers specializing in graphics for contributing the help they needed to accomplish this specific task.

while the game is nowhere near complete, egoboo's current form still has plenty of dungeon romping and monster-bashing.

ben says this may partly be because support for the lua language in egoboo "is not 'fully baked' as of now, from what i know."

the networking challenge is typical for this type of game.

so i'd like say what would get me to do a new release: a new level, significant bug fixes (networking, particles, etc.), and a good new [development] tool.
the egoboo graphics engine itself is not limited to dungeon crawlers.
there are still some lingering problems from the conversion, though, such as our flaky support for particles.
to rescue him, you must traverse dungeons in search of the "sporks of power".
as mentioned above, particle graphics do not rotate in the opengl version of the game like they do in the direct3d original.
as is standard in dungeon adventures, game play consists of combat against monsters, spell-casting, and exploring a variety of map levels.

"our main problem is that we haven't gotten around to porting the network code from the original directx. i think it would be a pretty straightforward job for a competent programmer with some spare time.
in fact, ben says his brother has already developed some of his own: "aaron always seemed to get distracted and [would] code up new games using the egoboo engine.

an extra, obvious benefit is that this decision makes customizing egoboo much easier: the mod community is full of people who are familiar with creating quake ii models.
