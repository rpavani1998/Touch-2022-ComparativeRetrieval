the documentation is far more comprehensive, the api has been partitioned into sensible functional sets to allow for smaller distributions, numerous stability and performance issues have been resolved.offering a plethora of great features matched with unparalleled support it is making java a real power in game development.the engine runs very stable and the performance is good.it is cross-platform, and is constantly improved with up to date features, along with a big and growing community base on the forums, make it easy for anyone to start programming in it.it has lots of features, good performance and the ease of developing in java!it is easier to use an engine, than to implement new graphical features or special effects.not only is it easy but with all the features they provide, terrain generation, configurable renderers to produce fantastic effects, you can do almost anything with it.it has an active and extremely supportive developer community, excellent getting started material, and a very straightforward api.our modular framework is programmed entirely in java to make it easy for you to deploy 3d games to desktop, web, and mobile platforms.this engine is very good to start with if you have zero 3d programming experience, because there are many tutorials of code samples which show you how to get started with basic examples.it is easy to use, it has a great community, it is stable and is pretty darn fast.the result is light weight, fast and modern with all the productivity advantages of java.it has some of the best water effects i have seen, and it is all very easy to use and completely functional.this is a much better engine then many i have seen, beating a lot of them in performance(even faster then torque, i have run both on the same computer), support, ease of use, and features.everything is very intuitive and once you get the basic idea you rarely need too look up the tutorials again (tutorails are community driven and fairly good).
