as for the deprecation mechanism, i would find it a lot more relevant if we were given some kind of timetable of when features are removed.
the problem with announcing details before they are well and truly finalized is that they can create false expectations, and this is very clearly what happened with longs peak.
as it happened to be , microsoft understood that games over the market are their main goal , and set direction there.
they understood that the graphic accelerators have undergone a heavy change and thus a major api change is due.

trust me , real good and fine people are looking up to serving you as opengl is a great hope for all of us who believe in the power of free software,openness and community.
you still need to mess with extensions to use geometry shaders, for example.
on the contrary : think of productive ways to have opengl offer more and be more attractive and associative than direct3d.
much of the hostility could have been avoided by simply being upfront and informative.
if you just stop to publish forward looking statements you release information like "working on it, reached mile stone one containing feature xy" once in a while.
this was magnified by the duration - the y axis - if it had only been a 3-4 month excursion then the frustration level would likely be lower.
there is probably also some amount of deliberate fudding from the competitor(s).
for now , you are correct, gamers have been hushed, which is , in my opinion , a pity as they are the real ones who tweak and peak the api's.
by liquidat on 2008-08-24@liquidat, sorry you feel that way, but it's the honest truth.
you won't get a new api, so don't wait for gl3.0".

if run a opengl 2.x or 1.x app on a system with opengl 3 installed, this removes major problems in 3.x.
by khronos member on 2008-08-24khronos member: sorry, but that is utterly bullshit.
although i say this, i don't think opengl 3 is the right step: opengl 2.x with a good set of arb extensions is simpler and provides the same: opengl was designed to provide extensibility thru extensions, core should be minimal.
but suddenly, it's all "yeah, we couldn't change ogl too much now, because you know, developers would have no time to adjust".
the only company i can think of that has actually removed deprecated functionality is apple.
as much as i dislike the way microsoft behaves in general, i liked what they did when they approached dx10.
so while i see that you think the technical side of the development is not that bad at all, i don't get how you can still be confident that there will be a next step in the development of opengl.
i'd really like to see the vaaaast authority from whence your gigantic self-important guru ego's spring.
that's a very different thing from putting up roadmaps committing to specific changes or timelines.
as i said though this isn't to imply that there can't be discussions about ideas for future revisions or extensions through any number of channels (opengl.org forum is a good one).
the first is to provide core… tags: 3d, developers, opengl
yep, you can shoot me down on 'tell me what that is".
what they did as of that moment, is that their labs sought the right api with their destination audience , they went to intel , nvidia, ati , and game companies and together they conceived a very nice api , who will, as i believe, undergo only minor changed to adapt itself to dx11 and later to dx12.
also, well pointed criticism does not need any project names - the authority is given by the argument, not by an authority.
instead of giving a new, flying colors, innovative api [i seem to get the impression many have expected] and lure new users inside, make everything faster and appealing.
allow to run oldies... those apps using older directx libs than installed in a computer.
the problem is that there was a total stop of communication on all levels regarding all topics.
the longs peak fans may have lost track of the fact that its feature set didn't even reach a complete dx9 level.
but in reality you gave everyone the idea that there is nothing done at all, that the project is dead or at least not really important.
by notgrumpy on 2008-08-19most of the extensions in gl 3.0 have been implemented in nvidia g80 series gpu, so i do not feel it's a greater improvement compared with the old.
indeed, it could still be calmed by providing the information grumpy is asking for.
you activate shader xyz, only to find out that performance tumbles.
khronos , on the other hand , (and again , i am speculating because as a member of this community i also feel i have been left out) sought to keep their audience without [as you say] making a big fuss.
but i have heard loud complaints 'from the development community'.
once they got that, they'd be happy to see new features, of course.
it does *not* work with current mainstream gpu's (because it needs juuuust a few features only available on dx10 gpu's).
all the appendix e stuff really removed, it's a huge good step in the correct direction imho.
after testing an approach that would have a drastic effect on the api, requiring complete opengl application rewrites and not introducing any of the long awaited features modern gpus are capable of, the choice was made to give programmers what they are really waiting for.
a roadmap that says nothing about the future isn't much of a roadmap.
the whole way of process of defining the spec was something vague and did not remind me of the former arb i knew which posted requests for comments, suggestions and other specs on the forum to allow developers to feel the pulse of the whole project.
should you ask me , they succeeded very much (trust me on that one , that's what i do for a living...) .
i have been to siggraph2008 and expected some ingenious idea like inversing the api : inventing a new api (as you promised in the beginning in the forums) to be more generic and less of a fixed approach and to declare all fixed function s as extensions of opengl3.0, thus allowing quick wranglers to quickly adapt to the situation , changing almost nothing for vendors , yet introducing new concepts to the world which will show that indeed much effort was put here and will share the process with the users.
users and developers,vendors and others cannot (!) trust khronos anymore to deliver anything reliable - because they showed that they are not able to communicate anything regarding the standard.
well, it seems like they managed to do so , their audience shall be safely kept.
it will not used for marketing or tracking in any way.

if you have a specific rendering or hardware feature that you feel would prevent you from writing opengl 3.0 code, you should write it up in the opengl.org forum, since the 3.1 definition effort is already underway.
the game developers in the working group for opengl have made it extremely clear that getting closer to current hardware capability (which means dx10 class hardware, as that is what is now available) should be the #1 priority, and this is the direction that has been taken for 3.0 - prioritizing integration of contemporary hardware capability above any sweeping api changes.
i believe this is the biggest problem the other problems are less important: - for use cuda or larrabee we may use opencl. - opengl is not an object oriented lib, maybe kronos should standarize a oo lib for those who demand it.
i don't hear any crucial common demoninator save a propensity for passive-agresssion through whining.
the whole power of open standards is from no other than the community which uses it, keep that in mind, oh distinguished khronos member, embrace your community as you walk towards 3.1 : share your ideas and thoughts and even your problems.
your email address will not be published.

this doesn't mean blocking off communication with the public as we're happy to discuss specific ideas or isv needs, but it would be off-policy for khronos members to post details or roadmaps relating exactly what will be in opengl 3.1 until it has reached a final or very-near-final state in the specification process.
heck, even the press contact of the khornos group didn't answer any e-mail, let alone giving a statement.
by clarks on 2008-08-18i'm not entirely unhappy with opengl 1.7, but it a disappointment.
note: registration is only used to validate postings.
which means that a "deprecated" label just seems like a slap in the face.
by khronos member on 2008-08-24khronos member, thx for your quick response.
so , once again a whole share of new , innovative, flexible audience is left aside.
i see that khronos member is referring to the forum.
as i said, i asked at the forums, i tried to reach the official press contact (!)
and thus , we shall continue working with an api like dx10's which is new , innovative, and rocks, and opengl3.0 will be , once again , the proprietary of those who write cad programs and professional flight simulators , like former mpi (presagis today) and companies who relay on sgi to do their work, because , believe it or not , sgi (at least these days) is heaving a little trouble finding support for new revisions of opengl.
you try to present the situation as you were not giving out too much information.
this is where the other webpages have picked up the outrage from.
i don't know, i just find it hilarious that khronos decided half a year ago to give up on the project they'd been getting extremely positive feedback from developers on, in order to "give developers what they really wanted"... without actually asking developers what they really wanted.
by anonymous on 2008-08-19you fail tom mention with any word the the entire process itself is broken entirely, mabye even beyond repair: an uncommented delay over almost a year is not acceptable.
game developers need to be hush hush to avoid creating hype.
by liquidat on 2008-08-19grumpy: "all" the developers are furious because you're just reading tabloid magazines of the web age, where all the whiners can be found.
the entire communication was shut down - totally.
in the specs you can find then: "well, if this feature is not supported by your hardware it will be simulated in software".
by santi on 2008-08-22the frustration is understandable - as well, many team members were frustrated that longs peak had not reached a shippable state after the time invested.
lp was simply long on schedule and short on features, so it was set aside.
a "we didn't have the guts to remove this, and we won't have the guts to remove it next year, or the year after, so to avoid losing face, we'll just put this "deprecated" sticker on it instead".
the spec document is not as beautiful as it could be, but really tutorials are the ones for making stuff easily understandable, not specs.
not again...' went up from estabilished community members and opengl users as the arb failed to deliver on it's promises.
which yielded the worst of both worlds, the project direction diverged from the roadmap, yielding frustration.
as for me, my name does not need any further explanation: i speak for myself but i am active in several open source projects.
these developers were *not* looking forward to new features, but to a cleaner, saner api for working with current mainstream gpu's where they can be relatively sure of finding the fast (hardware-accelerated) path.
and i also got an e-mail address of a board member whom i tried to contact.
the failure was in fluent communication, not in the delivery.
have a look at dx10/10.1/11, opengl does not unleash the capacity of gpu at all, so i do not like gl 3.0 a little.
as i said, i'm not an expert, but it seems that if the api is styled in the fashion of "just tell me what you want an i give it to you!
however, you (the khronos group) stoppped every communication - you created the image the khronos group is not working on it any more.
but adding features to an api that no one who has a choice actually uses is just not going to impress.
