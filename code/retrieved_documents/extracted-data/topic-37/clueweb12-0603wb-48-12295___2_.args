it's counter-intuitive to code, performs worse and lacks features than d3d. major developers (id etc) are using d3d even though they don't like being locked to windows, simply because it is far superior to opengl.graphics cards are getting flexible enough you can almost program a fast rendering engine yourself instead of using the standard rendering pathway.for those worried that direct3d 10/11 won't have the same kind of performance as opengl, barbieri said, "finally, a mature direct3d 10/11 implementation is intrinsically going to be faster and more reliable than an opengl implementation, thanks to the dramatically smaller api and the segregation of all nontrivial work to object creation that the application must perform ahead of time.he added, "thanks to a very clean and well-though design done from scratch, the direct3d 10/11 apis are vastly better than opengl and can be supported with orders of magnitude less code and development time, as you can see by comparing the lines of code of this commit and those in the existing mesa opengl implementation."it's really a great os, and given the chance, i'm sure it'll run the same apps that windows runs even better.and opengl and directx are really close, from feature and performance point of view.the cost associated to develop on a different api is too high.that's why wine developers have steered clear of re-implementing the same api features and why it's difficult to get many games working through wine.you can't create a new 3d api at present unless you implement a translation layer to either gl or d3d. it'd be like trying to write a new language or even a new compiler if the x86 spec was secret.not all linux users have an issue with the price of anything (except that they can fulfil their needs without cost).you can sell linux distros that are freely downloadable and you are not discouraged from doing so.microsoft works hard with the gaming industry and the vendors, the competition come from the consoles.well i don't know much about d3d since i write for linux, but when id etc switch away from the open software they support there must be a major advantage, and i don't think they're selling out to microsoft.game devs etc can only have things either as good (stick with gl and/or d3d) or better (a new api becomes better than those two).the only added cost is to the api designer.you could fine tune your pc to a point where you would get monster performance loading exactly what you need from the boot loader.
