they control low- level functions, including two- dimensional (2-d) graphics acceleration; support for input devices such as joysticks, keyboards, and mice; and control of sound mixing and sound output.sdl is comparable to directx as it offers control over sound, graphics, mouse/keyboard/joystick.by requiring the hardware to support to be '10.1 compatible' they are merely pandering to the majority of gamers out there.i can't see any reason why game development should not be point and click, if they made something like opengl easier to write for, i think it would be a positive for the game market, and might bring a viable alternative to microsoft open standards has some side effects.functionality wise it offers essentially what opengl does, except wrapped up in a platform-specific com interface.a fixed feature set is what allows developers to squeze out every drop of performance from ps2 hardware to make amazing looking graphics, even though your mobile phone might have more processing power available to it.it, however, required a lot more ram and faster cpu in order to run smoothly.from http://www.gamesforwindows.com/en-us/aboutgfw/pag e s/directx10.aspx [gamesforwindows.com] : directxÂ® apis gives multimedia applications access to the advanced features of high-performance hardware such as three-dimensional (3-d) graphics acceleration chips and sound cards.microsoft has completely eliminated the capability bits, or "capbits", concept in order to ensure to developers that if they program a specific version of the standard that all of the functionality mandatory by that standard will be supported by the graphics hardware.they listen to the api fixes and new features that game developers ask them for, and they work with graphics card manufacturers to expose new capabilities as soon as they are available, and release new directx sdks every few months.you missed the root cause of directx's success, which is that microsoft has been a lot more quickly responsive and to the concerns of developers and hardware designers.not to a 7800-series or comparable, and certainly not to an 8x00 or upcoming 9x00 geforce, unless driver stability improves dramatically, and they can add more real-world-useful features, particularly without the need for windows vista.d3d was the only hardware-agnostic solution back then aside from opengl (ati wasn't implementing glide), and the api mapped to the general hardware case well enough that it was relatively easy for most vendors to write good drivers for.it uses dirctx for graphics by default, but with the -opengl switch, it uses opengl for graphics, which works better for nvidia and wine users and is a carryover from mac os x support.if games are easier to write (skipping over the effectiveness/perceived effectiveness of any 'platform'), then there are more people writing games and becoming developers, which would make the game market more competitive, and thusly we would have better games!
