it allows a pc with no dedicated 3d graphics hardware to execute opengl applications at exceptional levels of performance and complements accelerated opengl products available from numerous 3d graphics hardware vendors.in-core support for thread-safeness has also been implemented enabling developers to take full advantage of java's powerful multi-threading.opengl is a used to draw images on the screen, not to do general geometry manipulation.this is slower than full-screen rendering, but essential when trying to debug on a single monitor setup.if you use opengl to do the transforms for your collision detection or other things you will need to use the feedback mechanism to get the transformed values back into your code.however, the software rendering is far in advance of the microsoft implementation (for political reasons) and some ihvs are basing their opengl libraries around this version, 3dfx for example.as a result, even with hardware geometry it will probably be faster to do the transforms yourself.if an opengl driver is available on the system then the library will automatically call microsoft's library so that the driver will be invoked during rendering.additional developer features include in-built interactive tracing and profiling of opengl calls.this is intended as a resource for all levels of opengl programmers, from beginner to expert.this allows you near full use of windows functions for debugging, though there can be problems with the 3dfx not knowing it's screen/window is visible (another dreaded black screen problem).to effect the high-performance rendering, magician interfaces directly with existing opengl installations in the form of native code.opengl miniports are there to support games such as quake, and they will usually only support a small subset of opengl commands.however, you might miss out on acceleration (for a similar reason to part 4 above), plus this approach makes supplying perspective-correct texture coordinates a headache.multi-pass can be done with standard blending and rendering techniques.
