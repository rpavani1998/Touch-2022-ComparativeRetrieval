by using premake, software developers can save time and support more tools and users.this will save you the trouble of embedding the scripts and recompiling with each change, and will greatly speed up development.these functions set up the project state and take care of error checking and the like.it saves the time that would otherwise be spent manually keeping several different toolsets in sync.visual studio and other ides provide facilities to quickly switch between configurations; premake-generated makefiles allow the configuration to be specified with a command-line parameter.and it provides an easy upgrade path as new versions of your favorite tools are released.premake provides a great deal of flexibility when it comes to configuring your build: you can apply settings across an entire solution, a project, or to a targeted combination of configuration and toolset.these scripts will run on any platform, ending batch/shell script duplication.it is small, weighing in at around 200k. it does not require any additional libraries or runtimes to be installed, and should build and run pretty much anywhere.if you frequently target several different platforms, and want to switch between them without regenerating your project files, you can add them directly to your script.premake also provides conventions for defining and handling command line options and actions, allowing you to build sophisticated configuration scripts.using configurations premake provides a great deal of flexibility when it comes to configuring your build: you can apply settings across an entire solution, a project, or to a targeted combination of configuration and toolset.ides like visual studio provide their own mechanism for switching build configurations.in addition to these project generation capabilities, premake also provides a completelua scripting environment, enabling the automation of complex configuration tasks, such as setting up new source tree checkouts or creating deployment packages.this user guide reflects the current state of the software fairly closely, but may lag in places, or get a little ahead of the official releases in others.
