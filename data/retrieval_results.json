A desktop computer can give you better performance and while you do need an outlet, you won't need to worry about your battery dying.

Connections to Servers From Dirk Janssen <dirkj_AT_u.arizona.edu>: Here are several good ways of working on your laptop from your desktop machine. If you have a separate desktop machine at work, you might want to use that as a terminal server to your laptop. This means you get the larger screen and the better keyboard, without having to worry about syncing files. The easiest way to do this is to install ssh on both sides, and ssh from your desktop (running X) to the laptop. Ssh will provide a secure connection and, crucially, a secure X connection between the two machines. If you type, for example,emacs & in the ssh shell, emacs will start a window on your desktop machine while running on your laptop. There are various ways in which you can make this situation more productive/complicated.", "uuid": "https://chatnoir.eu/cache?uuid=f481335a-9f44-59a6-830e-425c8fa21587&index=cw12&raw&plain"}, "source_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/row-data/topic-2/clueweb12-0603wb-27-03704___301.html", "content_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/extracted-data/topic-2/clueweb12-0603wb-27-03704___301.txt"}, {"_index": "raw_documents_url", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "clueweb12-0715wb-30-18724___7", "_score": 60.813362, "_ignored": ["text.keyword"], "_source": {"text": "I am looking to sell a laptop / desktop Reply Dealer New I am looking to sell a laptop / desktop .

Their greater speed and capacity make them better suited for video editing, computer aided design, and high-end gaming. A larger keyboard makes it easier to type and larger screen makes it easier to view. People using desktops are also generally less prone to ergonomic problems, such as neck and back strain from slumping over a small machine. Unless you're near an outlet, laptops are also limited by their battery life. And laptops are more easily stolen than larger desktop PCs, which is a big factor in organizational settings. Workarounds are available, however, to mitigate these issues. You can use a supplemental mouse, keyboard, and/or monitor with a laptop PC. Laptop stands can improve the ergonomics without requiring supplemental devices.

While desktops are more practical for home, laptops are mobile so you can actually get the best of both worlds. When deciding on laptop versus desktop here are some considerations and five reasons why a laptop maybe a better choice. 1.

Best regards, Bill Reply Craig says: September 12, 2009 at 4:20 AM After sending my Canon 20D back to Canon 5 times; getting a brand new Canon 1Ds MKII with a bad sensor; and sending my Canon 1Ds MKIII back to Canon for underexposing 2 full stops, I was ready to sell all my Canon lenses and move back to Nikon. Based upon Thom Hogan\u2019s (www.bythom.com) recent review of the Nikon D3X, and many other reviews of the Nikon, I have reconsidered this decision. I am a landscape photographer and I am very happy with the 1Ds MKIII\u2019s resolution, just not happy with Canon quality-control. It seems the D3X has its own set of problems that have been overlooked by reviewers that are afraid to honestly expose the flaws of this new camera.", "uuid": "https://chatnoir.eu/cache?uuid=c2420c66-fd8d-5145-a84b-a7b717f7add1&index=cw12&raw&plain"}, "source_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/row-data/topic-3/clueweb12-1415wb-74-12958___12.html", "content_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/extracted-data/topic-3/clueweb12-1415wb-74-12958___12.txt"}, {"_index": "raw_documents_url", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "clueweb12-0001wb-98-37238___5", "_score": 46.01277, "_ignored": ["text.keyword"], "_source": {"text": "The T3i is also more prone to chromatic aberration than the D5100. The Nikon also produces excellent images in both RAW and JPEG, and it does an even better job of keeping thenoise down at high ISOs. Best of all, it doesn't seem to share other DSLRs' tendencies to overexpose in high contrast situations. It also has better dynamic range and color depth than the Canon. In Conclusion I personally find the layout and control system of the Nikon confusing and somewhat lacking in key areas. However, image quality is where it counts, so, if you're new to digital cameras, then the Nikon has the edge. Both cameras have their plus points though, and users are unlikely to be disappointed by either machine. Suggested Reading Canon 7D Vs. Nikon D300s Canon T3 Vs.

PHP \u201cjust happened\u201d. Not to knock PHP (I actuallylove working in PHP) \u2014 but Python is just a better language. [Note: I still am viscerally troubled by the using whitespace to indicate code structure, instead of just using braces like the rest of the sane world, but it\u2019s a relatively minor gripe]. 2. Python has a \u201cclear\u201d web framework winner: Although conceptually I like having choices (and I believe in openness), practically, I really,really like standards. All things being equal, I much prefer that all of us are working with the same frameworks and libraries. Python mostly has that with Django. It\u2019s close to the de-facto choice for web frameworks in Python. Maybe not quite as dominant as Rails in Ruby-land \u2014 but close. Contrast that to PHP where we have Symfony, Zend, CodeIgniter, Kohana \u2014 and others. On the one hand, this kind of competition is good. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re all great frameworks (I use CodeIgniter right now), but the fact that there\u2019s no clear winner means that the market is fragmented. And, fragmentation is bad. It\u2019sparticularly bad when it comes to web frameworks. The learning curve these days is not a new language (it takes a proficient programmer just a few days to get her arms around the basics of a new language). The learning curve is with the framework. The deeper and richer the framework is, the more there is to learn. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Ilove frameworks (dating back all the way to the Object Windows Library that Borland had for TurboPascal). Frameworks have an upfront cost, but provide a ton of value long-term. But, if there are a bunch of different frameworks floating around, the odds that any given person is working in the same framework you are lower. And as such, getting someone new up to speed takes longer. In Python land, the clear web framework winner is Django. This means that if I find a great Python developer for the team (more on this later), they\u2019ve likely used Django. That makes life much easier. 3.", "uuid": "https://chatnoir.eu/cache?uuid=a193ef1c-62aa-59ce-bc04-b789dfd36aaa&index=cw12&raw&plain"}, "source_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/row-data/topic-8/clueweb12-0008wb-36-19669___7.html", "content_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/extracted-data/topic-8/clueweb12-0008wb-36-19669___7.txt"}, {"_index": "raw_documents_url", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "clueweb12-0011wb-34-22801___1", "_score": 41.74366, "_ignored": ["text.keyword"], "_source": {"text": "Stackato, a Private PaaS for Python, PHP, Java, and more, gets Management and Monitoring | Javalobby LOG IN or JOIN Home Refcardz Microzones NoSQL Zone HTML5 Zone DevOps Zone Solr-Lucene Windows Phone 7 .NET Zone Python Zone Zones Agile Zone Cloud Zone Mobile Zone Javalobby Web Builder Zone IDEs and Tools Eclipse Zone JetBrains Zone NetBeans Zone Languages PHP Zone Groovy Zone Architects Zone Book Zone Server Zone Library Links Snippets Trending: Lucene \u00b7 CSS \u00b7 Python \u00b7 PyPy \u00b7 Scala \u00b7 Heroku \u00b7 Solr \u00b7 IndexedDB \u00b7 Amazon Cloud \u00b7 Cloud Foundry \u00b7 WP7 \u00b7 ASP.NET Lucene 3.6 Gets Query Time Joining Windows 8: The Facts About ARM, Metro, and the Blu...

In the online bookDive Into Python, Mark Pilgrim puts it this way, \"After some initial protests and several snide analogies to Fortran, you will make peace with this and start seeing its benefits. One major benefit is that all Python programs look similar, since indentation is a language requirement and not a matter of style. This makes it easier to read and understand other people's Python code.\" One of the other features and main differences between Rails and Django is that Django has an \"Automatic admin interface\" which you can either take it or leave it.", "uuid": "https://chatnoir.eu/cache?uuid=7103bad9-7ad7-5ea0-94ae-42793a4ebc84&index=cw12&raw&plain"}, "source_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/row-data/topic-8/clueweb12-1901wb-09-07642___5.html", "content_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/extracted-data/topic-8/clueweb12-1901wb-09-07642___5.txt"}, {"_index": "raw_documents_url", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "clueweb12-1901wb-09-07642___9", "_score": 41.511505, "_ignored": ["text.keyword"], "_source": {"text": "Thanks - and welcome to the Django community! 3.

Comparing Linux and Windows security amounts to a \"chicken and egg\" issue, according to Kathy Ivens, an author and consultant.

One could also argue that Window - even NT - was not designed for multi-user environments and the the need to protect users - and programs - from each other. Linux security is all-or-nothing. Administrators cannot delegate administrative privileges: a user who needs any administrative capability must be made a full administrator, which compromises best security practices.

This book seeks to challenge common misgivings by showing how veterinary acupuncture works (for small and large animals), and why it should be established as an orthodox form of treatment.

Variety of programs available to local dog and cat owners By Sarah O. Smith Staff Writer For many, dogs and cats offer incomparable friendship and comfort.

However, when faced with the daunting veterinarian bills that new pets often bring, many pet owners don't know where to begin. Luckily, Pagosa is home to a number of options for dog and cat owners to lower their costs on the basic, yet vital medical care their pets require, such as spay and neuter operations and yearly vaccinations.

No more running back and forth between the kitchen and patio to complete your meal. When all your kitchen helpers disappear, you can handle it all yourself with a dual purpose combination grill. Gas charcoal grills come in different sizes. Some models are only marginally larger than an average grill. Others, such as the twin chamber charcoal and gas grills, are a bit larger.

The dry, white-hot heat of charcoal sears meat quickly, creating a crusty, caramelized exterior and smoky flavor. Of course, charcoal grilling requires more time and attention than gas, from building and lighting the briquettes to waiting for the coals to get hot to managing the flame. Since you can't dial down the heat of white-hot coals, it's a good strategy to leave empty spaces on the lower grill grate (areas without briquettes). These cool spaces allow for better control, letting you sear food first over the hot spots before transferring it to cooler parts to finish cooking.", "uuid": "https://chatnoir.eu/cache?uuid=a7134cc0-9772-5431-8668-09bd5fafbe9b&index=cw12&raw&plain"}, "source_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/row-data/topic-18/clueweb12-1000tw-84-12592___6.html", "content_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/extracted-data/topic-18/clueweb12-1000tw-84-12592___6.txt"}, {"_index": "raw_documents_url", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "clueweb12-0205wb-99-23127___2", "_score": 82.815216, "_ignored": ["text.keyword"], "_source": {"text": "Kalamazoo Dragon Burners\u2122 deliver over 115 BTUs of grilling power to each square inch of the primary grilling area, so these are seriously capable gas grills.

Curiously, NSS Labs found that despite using the same service, the three products had significantly different overall detection rates. Safari in particular had trouble communicating with the service, which partially explains the differences.

Quite separately, the browser itself is now looking dated with most alternative products offering tabbed browsing and other productivity enhancements. There are several excellent alternatives but Mozilla FireFox is the stand-out pick.

For example, the Jeep Wrangler is a very good vehicle for what it's supposed to do, but what it does well is pretty much one thing, so it isn't a great car in my opinion.

By Ed Hellwig | March 12, 2012 Comments (14) You may have noticed a greater number of new vehicles with odd looking headlights. It's a trend that BMW largely started awhile back with its corona ring design, quickly followed up by Audi and its LEDs.

The A4 also has on average more passenger room than the BMW 328, Mercedes C300, or Lexus IS250.

Match the size of the pan to the heating element; more heat will get to the pan and less will be lost to the surrounding air.

If you like the idea, might give it a shot. Obviously, try it out at home first. Don't be too impressed by their claims of \"turning the wax into gas\" stuff. Candles do that.

If the liquid or solid burned, the whole candle would light up at once. The \"our stove burns wax gas!\" line is just a gimmick to make it sound fancy.

The truth is, AA is big enough to get preferred pricing and early slots regardless. They wield enough buying power to make any aircraft manufacturer sit up and pay attention. So it doesn\u2019t hurt for AA to talk to Airbus. Is the Airbus A320/A321 the right aircraft? Quite possibly. The A321 will do a better job of fitting AA\u2019s requirements for a Boeing 757 replacement compared to the equivalent 737-900ER. It will fit almost all of the missions the 757 is currently serving (except for trans-Atlantic flights) and it will do it with pretty good efficiency compared to what Boeing is offering right now. Are they serious? Well, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this was both a warning shot over the bow to Boeing as well as a serious discussion. American Airlines really does need a better fleet going forward and it cannot afford to wait until 2019/2020 to get started. The 737-800 is a good fit as a MD-80 replacement but not as a 757 replacement.

Airbus will be pitching the A320/A321 NEOs and Boeing will be pitching the 737s (new and old) and it will be tough to call this one. I think who comes out on top in this order will be determined by who has slots for earlier deliveries of the more re-engined aircraft. If Airbus has slots, it will get orders. We know that Boeing has slots but order delivery dates are somewhat murky, in my opinion. I do not look for Bombardier CSeries or Embraer E190/195 aircraft to be ordered in this. They\u2019re smaller and Delta has that seat range covered right now. My best guess? I tilt towards this being Boeing\u2019s order. I think it might be won on price and an opportunity to get re-engined aircraft just a tad earlier than Airbus.

I don\u2019t always sense that they\u2019re defending the right things in the marketplace but, rather, defending their image against all comers. Reacting isn\u2019t always good. Take the Bombardier CSeries vs Airbus A319NEO scenario that is unfolding. Airbus COO John Leahy has actually come out and called for Bombardier to cancel the airplane. Airbus has pitted its A319NEO against the CS300 as the better aircraft and I\u2019d like to point something out. It\u2019s a mainliner by any definition and one based on a design that is 20+ years old. Boeing/McDonnel Douglas pitted the 717 against the Embraer 170/190 and got its hat handed to them. Picking your fights is an art. Some do it well, some don\u2019t. Boeing has done pretty good until recently although I think the influx of McDonnel Douglas execs hurt them. McDonnel Douglas execs never could decide when to fight so ended up hardly ever fighting. Airbus execus fight like bulldogs even when someone just happens to walk nearby. Airbus needs to understand that it isn\u2019t going to compete everywhere all of the time. Fighting off Bombardier and Embraer just expends money on low return investments. That said, Airbus also just racked up 700+ firm orders for the A320NEO and, that, my friends, is very healthy competition. Say what you want (like it doesn\u2019t include any US network carriers or Boeing customers), they put it up there in 6 months and they did it much like Boeing did the 787 orders.

KC135TopBoom July 11, 2011 at 6:36 am | #2 Reply | Quote I don\u2019t know that there will be a B-787-10, Boeing has been riding the fence of that model. I think you are right about the A-332 not being long for this world. I think it will end production (but still be offered) within 10 years, or so. I also think Airbus will cancel the A-358, as Boeing did with the B-783. The B-77W will eventually kill off the A-333, too. But it may have to struggle against the A-3510 if Airbus improves that model to more of what the ME airlines want, not in its \u201cnew\u201d current form.

No. Boeing is the best manufacturer of this type of aircraft in the world. But along came a government consortium called Airbus who could offer financing on their planes that no private company could match because the financing came from European governments who could just print the money they needed.

I admire the gusto in which they present themselves and the entreprenurial spirit with which they approach their brand management with. I dislike the bravado and somewhat cheap order tactics as well. After this Paris Airshow, a few things occur to me when it comes to Airbus. First, it is time to stop behaving like a teenager in this rivalry that exists with Boeing. Despite all the bravado, what we know is that both aircraft manufacturers pretty much compete evenly in the marketplace. Some years Airbus delivers more aircraft or sells more orders, other years it is Boeing that does so.

Both ASP and PHP have several tools and available options with their GUI options.

Because PHP is open source, features such as FTP, file uploads, XML and email are included, whereas these have to be paid for as add-ons for ASP users. Conclusion Lots more information about using ASP and PHP is available on the web. Safe to say, the two options have their benefits and their disadvantages.

Some of the pros of ASP is that since it primarily uses VBScript it's relatively easy to pick up the language if you're already know how to program in Visual Basic. ASP support is also enabled by default in the IIS server making it easy to get up and running.

Speed Well, many of us are under the impression that Eclipse is faster. That however, is arguable. In slower machines Eclipse works much better. I did some test on my own with both of them. The basic Netbeans Java package is slower than the basic eclipse J2EE package. But the reason for this is probably because Netbeans loads a lot more plugins than Eclipse does. The full Netbeans package is 380MB with all the bells and whistle, which supports pretty much anything out of the box, but the full Eclipse package (Eclipse doesn't have an official full package, so created a package with similar functionalities as Netbeans full package), well, about 1.3 GB.

As versatile and capable as the 2010 Toyota Sequoia is, buyers who don't require its massive towing capacity would do well to consider a large crossover like the GMC Acadia (or its Buick Enclave/Chevy Traverse relatives), Ford Flex or Mazda CX-9. These crossovers offer competitive passenger and cargo space with lower price tags, and they handle better and get superior fuel economy to boot. Still, for those who need a heavy-duty, full-size SUV, the 2010 Toyota Sequoia reigns supreme.

Ford and Toyota believe that their collaboration will allow them to bring these hybrid technologies to customers sooner and more affordably than either company could have accomplished alone. \"This agreement brings together the capability of two global leaders in hybrid vehicles and hybrid technology to develop a better solution more quickly and affordably for our customers,\" saidDerrick Kuzak, Ford group vice president, Global Product Development.", "uuid": "https://chatnoir.eu/cache?uuid=ef0bd9df-8f9c-5a27-860b-b679c1d65551&index=cw12&raw&plain"}, "source_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/row-data/topic-42/clueweb12-0211wb-11-20090___2.html", "content_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/extracted-data/topic-42/clueweb12-0211wb-11-20090___2.txt"}, {"_index": "raw_documents_url", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "clueweb12-1812wb-94-23278___2", "_score": 54.57389, "_ignored": ["text.keyword"], "_source": {"text": "Print Blog Post Detail \u2190 Back to Blog Featured Pre-Owned Trucks Cleveland Heights OH 44118 Published Tuesday, 24 April, 2012 Ford E-350 Cutaway Standard Toyota Tundra SR5 GMC Sierra 2500HD SLE1 With a huge assortment of trucks in stock, you'll be sure to find something that meets your needs, and your budget.

The finish is kuro-uchi (black) with a lacquer coating -- this helps protect the steel and should not be polished off.

A black (HIP) blade is made out of a black zirconium oxide and offers extra durability.

Most ceramic blades are white, though there is a growing number of grey and black ceramic knives. The hardness of the ceramic gives these knives their long-lasting good looks, as well as a razor sharp edge that does not require sharpening for years. That is why many chefs love using ceramic knives. This sharpness makes slicing easier, allows precise cuts and extremely thin slices.

My property is surrounded by oak trees, and I've pushed the envelope by growing fruit trees right up to the canopy. In general, the apples that get Morning sun until noon seem to fruit prolifically, whereas the apples that get no Morning sun, but afternoon sun seem to fruit a lot less, much more biennially. What's interesting is that for example stone fruits like peaches are much less sensitive, fruiting like crazy in the same locations. As a whole, I've noticed much more open growth near the oak trees.

Another advantage to fishing near dawn and dusk is stealth - the potential for more strikes rises since trout are now easily spooked by even the slightest shadow that falls across a likely lie during daylight hours.", "uuid": "https://chatnoir.eu/cache?uuid=bae0a3a0-14e4-52b3-95ed-f921459d9952&index=cw12&raw&plain"}, "source_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/row-data/topic-54/clueweb12-0207wb-19-17297___52.html", "content_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/extracted-data/topic-54/clueweb12-0207wb-19-17297___52.txt"}, {"_index": "raw_documents_url", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "clueweb12-1115wb-70-07606___11", "_score": 39.380173, "_ignored": ["text.keyword"], "_source": {"text": "At the top of the photograph are shown the positions of the Sun in the sky in June and July, while the positions in December and January are shown at the bottom.

I like The Simpsons and South Park, but Family Guy is alot more funnier imo. The Simpsons is still good to watch, it's just not the same anymore though. The older episodes are alot more funnier than the current ones.

Another difference between snowboarding and skiing is that snowboarding works better in deeper, softer snow, whereas skis are much better handling bumps and ice. Also, they say that getting up on a snowboard is easier than getting up and getting yourself together on skis.

It\u2019s a tale of ultimate sacrifice that does not talk down to its readers but rather invites them to experience the drama along with the X-Men as this modern day tragedy unfolds. I am not a big X-Men fan but this is, without a doubt, one of the must read comic book stories of all time. NOTE: It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the wonderfulKitty Pryde makes her debut in this story as well. Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars \u2013 Long before Fear Itself, Civil War, or House of M, long before big company crossovers and big event storylines became everyday humdrum in the comic industry, there wasMarvel Super Heroes Secret Wars. This twelve issue maxi-series featured the world\u2019s greatest heroes (theAvengers, Fantastic Four, X-Men, Spider-Man and theHulk) as they are kidnapped by a being of ultimate power and whisked to the far side of the cosmos to engage in mortal combat against a small army of the Marvel U\u2019s most dangerous super villains. Not only was Secret Wars one of the first Big Event stories but with its long lasting effects on the Marvel Universe, it encapsulated everything a Big Event should be. The Thing quits the FF and the She-Hulk joins the team, the next year for the Hulk is set-up,Colossus ends his romantic relationship with Kitty Pryde, we are introduced to a new hero (Spider-Woman) and new villains (Volcana and Titania), theAbsorbing Man gets a girlfriend whom he is with to this very day, Magneto sides with the White Hats, andSpider-Man gets his black costume which later joins with Eddie Brock to becomeVenom. One of my favorite things about this story is the character-to-character interactions. This was at a time in Marvel\u2019s history when the Marvel Age was still young enough where all the heroes didn\u2019t know each other inside and out and quite frankly didn\u2019t necessarily get along. Friendships and bonds that exist today can be traced back to this original ultimate team-up. Crisis on Infinite Earths \u2013 Crisis is the biggest, best, most influential Big Event to ever be produced. It literally changed the landscape of the DC Universe. Heroes died, whole galaxies crumbled, and the DCU has never been the same since. When an unstoppable force starts to rip through the multiverse and destroy everything in its path, every single hero and villain on every single remaining parallel Earth in every single time era, from the dawn of mankind to the far-flung future, must unite to save all reality. Marv Wolfman and George Perez deliver the most epic super hero story ever told. And by the end of it, the DCU re-launched stronger and better than ever. For the next twenty-five years this would be known as the Post-Crisis DCU. Much like DC Comics is doing now with the New 52,Superman ,Wonder Woman, SHAZAM, Aquaman, Flash and the Justice League all restarted from number one and reintroduced and revamped their characters for a whole new generation, my generation. Batman: Year One told the tale of how a young rooftop vigilante outlaw became a hero. And it was all set up by the mega-event that isCrisis on Infinite Earths. Crisis features the greatest super heroes in the world fighting against the greatest threat the world has ever seen. It\u2019s just epic and a classic comic book story that absolutely must be read. Other tales of great note include: Rom the Spaceknight, Avengers: Under Siege, JLA: Rock of Ages, The Sinestro Corps War, and Annihilation.", "uuid": "https://chatnoir.eu/cache?uuid=40b565b1-054c-520f-8723-1e87e5779745&index=cw12&raw&plain"}, "source_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/row-data/topic-61/clueweb12-1004wb-85-02030___10.html", "content_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/extracted-data/topic-61/clueweb12-1004wb-85-02030___10.txt"}]}, {"topic": {"id": "62", "title": "Plastic pots or ceramic pots, which is better in terms of plant health?", "object_1": "plastic pots", "object_2": "ceramic pots"}, "documents": [{"_index": "raw_documents_url", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "clueweb12-0301wb-85-09681___2", "_score": 48.90628, "_ignored": ["text.keyword"], "_source": {"text": "To be successful at maintaining plant health and vigor, we must choose the correct type and size container and fill with an equally well selected soil mix.

Growing Requirements Containers impose obvious restrictions on the root systems of plants. In the garden, roots are able to exploit a large volume of soil to obtain moisture and nutrients.

Ceramic pots often are not glazed on the bottom and can leave moisture-marks on furniture and carpets. The only problem with an undrained pot is that excess water is not removed automatically.

Moving Plants Cold weather (<50\u00b0F) Tropical plants brighten the indoors and add to our homes. However, one should be aware that these plants do not like the cold and will suffer damage from even brief exposure to air near freezing. When transporting them in winter (or any day when the temperature is below 50\u00b0!), it is important that plants be carefully wrapped. Wrap small plants in newspaper (roll pot to make a tube and fold over the excess paper at the top). Place larger plants (or several newspapered small plants) in a large plastic garbage bag.

Use clippers to get a smooth cut, and make the cut just above a growth bud. The best times to prune a plant are when it is in active growth (usually in the spring) or soon after it has bloomed. Some plants such as true Palms have only one growth point and trimming the top will kill the plant. Containers Which is better a clay pot, a plastic pot, a ceramic pot, an undrained container, or a pot with drainage holes and a saucer? Many indoor gardens attribute the success of failure of their plants to the type of container used for growing! Instead, look to the type of potting mixture being used and your watering habits. 90% of plants having problems are due to the nature of the growing medium. Most commercial potting soils are too dense, tend to compact and inhibit new root growth. Instead of being concerned that a pot \u201cbreathes\u201d look for a loose porous potting mix that allows roots oxygen.

Thus, in an online environment, learning requires an added level of personal discipline. The temptation to procrastinate and catch up later is powerful, but must be resisted! A traditional class presents students with opportunities for real-time discussion, lectures from which notes can be taken, and an opportunity for immediate feedback from the instructor. Online classes almost always include\"threaded discussions\" which are conversations facilitated electronically within thelearning management system. The asynchronous nature of online learning means that you may not receive immediate feedback on your comments or questions.

In light of another discussion recently where a homeschool mother was requesting tips because she was going to write a book to help families figure out the perfect way to homeschool, this discussion resonated with me. Isn\u2019t the fact that homeschooled adults aren\u2019t perfect, likely related to the fact that most homeschooling families aren\u2019t perfect, because the members, including dad and mom aren\u2019t perfect? Ain\u2019t that a shocker to admit? While I personally don\u2019t know any homeschooled kids who have turned out so terribly bad, it stands to reason that with homeschooling families being a microcosm of our society in general, and individuals having free will, some homeschooled adults will choose things that go totally against the way they were raised. If we look around at the imperfect world we live in and all the pressures of the society we live in, we really can\u2019t be that surprised, can we? I think it\u2019s a fallacy for parents (homeschooling or not) to take credit for our adult children\u2019s successes or failures. We do the best we can in an imperfect world, to raise them with the values we cherish, and then they make their gradual way out into the world to make their own choices. Our hearts rejoice when they choose wisely and when life is good to them (sometimes as a direct result of their choices but sometimes no thanks to them) and we grieve and yearn over them when they don\u2019t choose wisely, or when life knocks them down again and again. However, much as we\u2019d like to take credit for their success, it\u2019s not really ours to own. And likewise, when our kids (adults, but yes, still our kids, in our hearts) choose horribly and end up in the ditch and either don\u2019t choose to or find themselves unable to crawl back out again, we really shouldn\u2019t beat ourselves up for it. I used to arrogantly think that when adult kids made rotten choices, their parents must have failed horribly in some way. But I don\u2019t believe that any more. That may be true in some cases, but it\u2019s been proven over and over and over to me that sometimes no matter how wonderfully kids are parented (and homeschooled) they don\u2019t always turn out that well. (And how many families do you know who have several children that turned out wonderfully well, and then there\u2019s that one that just turned out terrible? Same parents, same environment, different kid). . . .", "uuid": "https://chatnoir.eu/cache?uuid=d9b2235a-8666-5646-8ba5-32edfde23a92&index=cw12&raw&plain"}, "source_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/row-data/topic-72/clueweb12-0008wb-78-27740___7.html", "content_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/extracted-data/topic-72/clueweb12-0008wb-78-27740___7.txt"}, {"_index": "raw_documents_url", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "clueweb12-1900tw-12-14840___4", "_score": 33.7686, "_ignored": ["text.keyword"], "_source": {"text": "Or better yet, let\u2019s not !

Common artificial sweeteners have very little name recognition, the poll found, so parents are unaware of what they\u2019re giving their children. For example, according to poll results, acesulfame k, the sweetener that the CSPI thinks should be off the market, is virtually unknown to parents. Only five percent of parents polled identified it correctly.

It is natural, because simply divides the list into two equal sub-lists then sort these two partitions applying the same rule.

A. R. Hoare comes with a brilliant sorting algorithm. In general quicksort consists of some very simple steps. First we\u2019ve to choose an element from the list (called a pivot) then we must put all the elements with value less than the pivot on the left side of the pivot and all the items with value greater than the pivot on its right side. After that we must repeat these steps for the left and the right sub-lists. That is quicksort! Simple and elegant! It is a pure divide and conquer approach as merge sort, but while merge sort\u2019s tricky part was merging the sorted sub-lists, in quicksort there are other things to consider.

Goat milk contains more essential fatty acids (linoleic & archidoic acids) and higher proportion of short chain and medium chainfatty acids than cows milk.

The value of goat milk in human nutrition has so far received very little factual and academic attention (Haenlein, 1984, 1988, 1992; Park, 1991).", "uuid": "https://chatnoir.eu/cache?uuid=b267c77a-74b0-5f5b-8336-e7d6428a7ca3&index=cw12&raw&plain"}, "source_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/row-data/topic-84/clueweb12-0915wb-02-13942___2.html", "content_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/extracted-data/topic-84/clueweb12-0915wb-02-13942___2.txt"}, {"_index": "raw_documents_url", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "clueweb12-0305wb-47-10073___2", "_score": 38.74939, "_ignored": ["text.keyword"], "_source": {"text": "Caprotein is a premium quality goat-milk protein powder.

Unlike the metaphysically oriented literature of the 1990s, the strategy for addressing the problem of consciousness in philosophy of psychology involves direct engagement with empirical investigation into the nature of attention and perception.

Excerpt: The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Psychology follows Ned Block's classic anthology, Readings in Philosophy of Psychology (1980/1) by nearly thirty years. The differences between these two books signal the changed character, as well as the dramatic expansion, of the field. In this introduction, we describe some of the prominent characteristics of the Companion and explain how it reflects the current state of the field. In recent decades and across almost all domains in the brain and behavioral sciences, there has been a steady push towards multidisciplinary collaboration and cooperation.

In summary, a random forest model is a good choice for model building for a number of reasons. First, just like decision trees, very little, if any, pre-processing of the data needs to be performed. The data does not need to be normalised and the approach is resiliant to outliers. Second, if we have many input variables, we generally do not need to do any variable selection before we begin model building. The random forest model builder is able to target the most useful variables. Thirdly, because many trees are built and there are two levels of randomness and each tree is effectively an independent model, the model builder tends not to overfit to the training dataset.

They derive their strength from two aspects: using random subsamples of the training data (as in bagging) and randomizing the algorithm for learning base-level classifiers (decision trees). The base-level algorithm randomly selects a subset of the features at each step of tree construction and chooses the best among these. We propose to use a combination of concepts used in bagging and random subspaces to achieve a similar effect. The latter randomly select a subset of the features at the start and use a deterministic version of the base-level algorithm (and is thus somewhat similar to the randomized version of the algorithm).", "uuid": "https://chatnoir.eu/cache?uuid=c8974384-77d2-501e-8348-a6a904fa03eb&index=cw12&raw&plain"}, "source_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/row-data/topic-91/clueweb12-0408wb-33-05626___2.html", "content_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/extracted-data/topic-91/clueweb12-0408wb-33-05626___2.txt"}, {"_index": "raw_documents_url", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "clueweb12-1306wb-49-06042___18", "_score": 26.28326, "_ignored": ["text.keyword"], "_source": {"text": "This was done for a variety of classifiers such as Artificial Neural Networks[28], Random Forests [ 29], and SVM [30].

These water sources are non-potable, and vary greatly in quality. Most of the on-site water resources have limited application, and are never suitable for human consumption. The following is a brief overview of such resources that may be available in both residential and non-residential settings. Rain Water Harvesting Probably the original alternate water source, rainwater harvesting dates back to pre-historic times in rudimentary forms. Some plants and animals use the practice to enhance survival. Desert plants, such as agave, form concave appendages to capture rain drops and direct the water towards the root zone. Porcine root out pits capturing rain water to form small ponds. By 300 B.C., the Nabataeans had already built miles of an elaborate rain water collection system and storage cisterns to supply water to their city of Petra, in what is now the country of Jordan. In whatever size and form, rainwater harvesting usually is one of the purest waters available of all the alternate water sources. Despite its imitial purity, rain water can be easily contaminated by: air-pollution; heavy metals and other toxins in roofing materials, paints, solvents, lead soldering, zinc coatings and adhesives; bird and rodent feces; and mosquitoes. It is never advised to use untreated rainwater for direct human consumption, though human have been consuming it for centuries with little documented ill-effects when precations are taken to prevent contamination. It is often advised for people to avoid prolonged skin contact, and be wary of the stored water becoming septic or a breeding place for mosquitoes and pathogens. It has also been observed that residents of home cisterns tend to be more tolerant of their own cistern water quality than visitors that imbibe in the cistern water.. Rain Barrels There is a growing trend of water utilities offering free or price-discounted pre-fabricated plastic rain barrels to residential customers. These barrels are connected to the downspouts of the home\u2019s roof gutters to collect the rain water from the roof. The rain barrels include a tap at the bottom of the barrel for users to attach garden hoses as a means to convey the water to landscape plants. (Rain water is superior to treated potable water for irrigating plants.) The barrels also have an overflow spout and hose to divert excess water away from the home\u2019s foundation.", "uuid": "https://chatnoir.eu/cache?uuid=e95f9623-95f2-5ffe-9fee-4b9181a266dd&index=cw12&raw&plain"}, "source_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/row-data/topic-93/clueweb12-1711wb-43-10660___2.html", "content_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/extracted-data/topic-93/clueweb12-1711wb-43-10660___2.txt"}, {"_index": "raw_documents_url", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "clueweb12-0106wb-12-03296___31", "_score": 31.237577, "_ignored": ["text.keyword"], "_source": {"text": "Great website! :> +1 ... written by joe, June 01, 2011 okay everybody, distilled water costs A DOLLAR A GALLON, and rain water is FREE. how hard is it to buy one gallon, which will water your plant for well over a month, maybe even two? the time you spent on here asking about other types of water you could have spent getting the water recommended by every carnivorous plant website on the internet. everybody who asked about the different types of water are obviously unexperienced, so your plants are gonna die anyways. +3 can you buy distilled water written by Acidburn, July 16, 2011 i was wondering if you can buy distilled water? like in target store. will this be good or what do i do? http://www.target.com/Market-P...primary_c olor-bin,target_com_size-bin,target_com_brand-bin&frombrowse=0", "uuid": "https://chatnoir.eu/cache?uuid=100306e7-1d9c-54a0-afaf-b58b49035acd&index=cw12&raw&plain"}, "source_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/row-data/topic-93/clueweb12-0106wb-12-03296___31.html", "content_file_path": "/work/ejoo/Touche-2022-ComparativeRetrieval/code/retrieved_documents/extracted-data/topic-93/clueweb12-0106wb-12-03296___31.txt"}, {"_index": "raw_documents_url", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "clueweb12-1203wb-56-39332___2", "_score": 31.186329, "_ignored": ["text.keyword"], "_source": {"text": "Close the taps well after use.
