<title>Which is better, a laptop or a desktop?</title>
<objects>laptop, desktop</objects>
<description>A user wants to buy a new PC but has no prior preferences. They want to find arguments that show in what personal situation what kind of machine is preferable. This can range from situations like frequent traveling where a mobile device is to be favored to situations of a rather "stationary" gaming desktop PC.</description>
<narrative>Highly relevant documents will describe the major similarities and dissimilarities of laptops and desktops along with the respective advantages and disadvantages of specific usage scenarios. A comparison of the technical and architectural characteristics without personal opinion, recommendation, or pros/cons is not relevant.</narrative>

<objects>PHP, Python</objects>
<description>With no previous coding experience, a young user plans to start learning programming mostly for web development by attending a course at a coding school. But they have seen some online comments on the advantages and disadvantages of these two programming languages. Given a limited amount of time (and money), the user wants to choose just one course to learn coding in either language and needs to be sure to choose the better option.</description>
<narrative>Relevant documents may contain an overview of more than these two programming languages and can include subjective opinions of anonymous online users and experienced coders. Highly relevant documents should include an explicit and justified recommendation on which of the languages to better start within what scenarios (e.g., job perspectives or ease of including deep learning pipelines).</narrative>

<objects>Train, plane</objects>
<description>A frequent traveler (domestic and international) wants to reconsider their preference for taking a plane given global warming but also security issues like plane crashes from smaller airlines. The users want to get an idea of the environmentally, economic, and most secure travel option for different regions around the world (e.g., Europe with some good train systems in some countries vs. the U.S. market with some longer distances).</description>
<narrative>A highly relevant document will contrast the eco-friendliness of trains with their current top speeds to figure out distance ranges/circumstances that favor trains over planes and vice versa. Highly relevant documents may also contain the alternative of using a ship for intercontinental travels. Besides eco-friendliness, also comfort, security, or other aspects can be used in the explanations and expert and amateur experience, statistics, and studies should be included. A relevant document will not contain a fully verbalized comparison but may help to collect the needed facts to pursue, for instance, an eco-friendliness or a security-focused comparison at the user side.</narrative>

<description>A person thinks of getting a pet but is not sure whether they want to have a cat or a dog. They look for advice from others on what is more manageable for a beginner (e.g., what dog breed to favor without any previous experience), whether cats or dogs in general are considered to be more loyal, friendlier, or cleaner, and also what budget needs to be considered finance-wise.</description>
<narrative>Highly relevant documents will discuss advantages and inconveniences of both having cats or dogs as pets while relevant documents may only contain personal opinions or anecdotes on either owning a cat or a dog.

<objects>gas, charcoal</objects>
<description>A person having just decided to start their very first grilling season by buying a grill faces the question that cooks have been asking for decades since the first grill went on sale in the 1950s: Gas or charcoal? Obviously a tricky decision that depends on the actual individual preferences. For instance, many say that it is better to get a great smoky flavor from cooking over charcoal.</description>
<narrative>Highly relevant documents contain pros and cons for both: using natural gas or using charcoal for outdoor grilling (e.g., flavor, ease of use, eco-friendliness, etc.). A relevant document might just contain opinions of people who share their experience with just one of the options while documents that include only definitions of using charcoal and natural gas, in general, are not relevant.</narrative>

<description>A person is thinking about replacing their old desktop machine by a new one. Without any "religious" preference for either the Mac or PC universe, they are willing to consider buying from either "side". For such an unbiased user, the potential differences between Macs and PCs should be highlighted---probably even that some people believe that the best way to describe the difference between a Mac and a PC is that they represent two different ways of thinking.</description>
<narrative>Highly relevant documents discuss differences between a Mac and a PC (e.g., software availability, price range, design, vulnerability to viruses, etc.) and express preferences on the respective differences. Relevant documents may contain user opinions who are very happy or also very dissatisfied with some choice on Mac vs. PC that they made but without longer comparisons of both worlds.

<description>When it comes to soft drinks, there are two kinds of people: people who team up with Coca-Cola and those who are Pepsi players. Both Coca-cola and Pepsi dominate the market of soft drinks and pretty much everyone has a preference for one over the other, without knowing the difference. In order to learn more about the two camps (and maybe to be able to choose one side but not for the sake of trolling), the user wants to compare them in terms of nutritional content (sugar, calories, sodium-content, and caffeine), taste (acidity, vanilla-like), number of people who buy Coke or Pepsi in different countries, etc.</description>
<narrative>Highly relevant documents contain a comparison of Coke soda and Pepsi soda based on facts (nutrition-wise, sales, etc.) and general opinions from other persons. A relevant document at least states an explicit preference with respect to for instance sugar content or caffeine while irrelevant documents do not come with a preference but for instance only with lists of ingredients.</narrative>

<description>Even though the tech company Google has created a strong brand name with respect to web search (and other things), some people favor the Yahoo search experience, which is powered by Bing since 2009. Without the intent of trolling, a user is considering to move away from the 90%+ camp of Google search users and has heard that Yahoo once was a good search engine. In particular, there might be scenarios where Yahoo search results (i.e., Bing) are still on par with Google or maybe even better. The user wants to know more about these scenarios (and the ones where Google has advantages) in order to decide whether switching search engines (at least from time to time) might be reasonable. Aspects of the comparisons for potential different use cases/scenarios (e.g., general web search, image search, Twitter search, QA platform, etc.) could be: quality of the search results, speed, ease of access and usage, search reliability, privacy, interactive features, etc.</description>
<narrative>Highly relevant documents contain user opinions / comparisons of at least Google and Yahoo (or Bing but then stating that Bing powers most of Yahoo's search results) in different scenarios and/or general user share etc. Documents that contain just a comparison of for instance image search abilities can be considered relevant. Documents comparing the Google and Yahoo stock or comparing other non-search issues are not relevant.</narrative>

<description>A user needs to buy a new company car and is pretty sure that it should be one manufactured in Germany to impress their customers---still not being sure whether it should be BMW or Audi (Mercedes for some reason already was ruled out). Now, the user searches for technical characteristics and reviews on cars from both brands including price, engine power, durability, ecological impact, reliability, etc. The users hopes to avoid reading through dozens of articles and wants to find one solid review comparing the brands---ideally with an emphasis on the usage as a company car.</description>
<narrative>Highly relevant documents compare BMW and Audi cars like the BMW 3, 5, and 7 series to Audi’s A4, A6, or A8 series with respect to their aspects like speed, horsepower, price, reliability, etc. It is also OK, if some further car manufacturers are part of the comparison, but BMW and Audi need to be present. Ideally, such documents include recommendations on particular models and a conclusion which of the two brands should be preferred and why in what class (3 series vs. A4, etc.). Relevant documents may discuss cars from either BMW or Audi along some of the mentioned aspects but without a final comparison of an BMW to an Audi car. Documents that include only historical background on the two car manufacturers, or other content that does not help to decide for a specific car model from BMW or Audi are not relevant.</narrative>

In a family's discussion in early December, the question again pops up: Is buying a real or buying an artificial Christmas tree greener and more environmentally friendly? The family searches for more information and discussions on differences between a real and a fake Christmas tree from the ecological point of view (e.g., tree plantations cover vast territories of wildlife habitat while artificial trees are shipped long distances overseas (but may be "used" more than once), etc.).</description>
<narrative>Highly relevant documents compare real and fake Christmas trees discussing ecological and environmental impacts of their production and shipping and include a conclusion on the issue. Relevant documents may only cover either real of artificial trees' eco-"footprint" or may compare both variants but not with a clear focus on the ecological issue but potentially other benefits/disadvantages.
