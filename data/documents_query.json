times consumers may opt to have both, but for many this is not an affordable option and in reality is unnecessary. While desktops are more practical for home, laptops are mobile so you can actually get the best of both worlds. When deciding on laptop versus desktop here are some considerations and five reasons why a laptop maybe a better choice. 1. Mobility The number one argument for laptops is of course mobility and portability. Laptops offer full computer capabilities without the hassle of a plug. They can be used at the beach as well as at home at your workstation, desk or couch while watching TV. You certainly could not do that with a desktop. And because today's laptops offer full and powerful features, they can actually serve as replacement laptops, such as several Dell computers models. The other advantage is the ability to surf the web to shop or check email from anywhere, which can be especially beneficial for work and business or to just communicate with friends and family.","1":"Gateway's NV75S17u is more affordable, offers more memory and RAM and has better integrated graphics but no Blu-ray drive. Finally, theMSI FR720 offers a faster i7 quad core processor and more RAM but lacks the Blu-ray support. Overall, each of these options is just a bit better than Sony's depending upon the needs of the consumer.

Their greater speed and capacity make them better suited for video editing, computer aided design, and high-end gaming. A larger keyboard makes it easier to type and larger screen makes it easier to view. People using desktops are also generally less prone to ergonomic problems, such as neck and back strain from slumping over a small machine. Unless you're near an outlet, laptops are also limited by their battery life. And laptops are more easily stolen than larger desktop PCs, which is a big factor in organizational settings. Workarounds are available, however, to mitigate these issues. You can use a supplemental mouse, keyboard, and\/or monitor with a laptop PC. Laptop stands can improve the ergonomics without requiring supplemental devices. AViiQ has recently introduced its Portable Laptop Stand which, unlike most other laptop stand, folds up so you can carry it along with the laptop.","3":"New processors, graphics cards, sound cards, screen resolution are being introduced in newer versions of Dell desktops and laptops in order to provide Dell users a better alternative to computing. Due to these reasons it is necessary that you can get Dell upgrade. Dell upgrade basically means that you add new software and hardware components to your existing Dell desktop or laptop in order to enhance its performance. With Dell upgrade you will be able to enjoy the best alternatives of technology, which can help you get better multimedia and gaming experience. For example, if you have an old Dell desktop computer with an Intel Dual Core processor and you are thinking of installing a game that requires at least Intel i7 processors, then you will have to upgrade to a newer processor. In order to implement Dell upgrade you need the assistance of a technical expert.","4":"15.6. Connections to Servers From Dirk Janssen <dirkj_AT_u.arizona.edu>: Here are several good ways of working on your laptop from your desktop machine. If you have a separate desktop machine at work, you might want to use that as a terminal server to your laptop. This means you get the larger screen and the better keyboard, without having to worry about syncing files. The easiest way to do this is to install ssh on both sides, and ssh from your desktop (running X) to the laptop. Ssh will provide a secure connection and, crucially, a secure X connection between the two machines. If you type, for example,emacs & in the ssh shell, emacs will start a window on your desktop machine while running on your laptop. There are various ways in which you can make this situation more productive\/complicated.","5":"Windows 7 Home Premium, Office Starter, Guide Review - ASUS K73E-XA1 17.3-inch Desktop Replacement Laptop PC Jul 6 2011 - The ASUS K73E series of laptops is more of a budget oriented laptop rather than a full performance desktop replacement. This is clearly evident as the current high end model K73E-XA1 uses a middle classed Intel Core i5-2410M dual core processor. This certainly provides good performance for most cases but those wanting to do desktop video would be better served by a quad core i7 processor. Continuing with the more budget theme, the processor is matched up with 4GB of DDR3 memory which lets it run smoothly but 8GB would be a better overall room for growth. Storage features for the ASUS K73E-XA1 are actually quite good for a laptop of this price range. It comes with a spacious 750GB hard drive that provides plenty of space for applications, data and media files.","6":"There are a few upgrades you can make to a used laptop computer that will really improve the value and your ability to run software and actually use the thing. The good news is that as long as your laptop has USB 1.1 or better connectivity, you can use pretty much the same peripherals as brand new notebooks. The bad news is if your laptop doesn't have any USB ports it's going to be a challenge doing anything new with it. Desktop Computers - Most popular upgrades Install card reader Replace keyboard\/mouse Add\/replace memory Upgrade CPU heatsink\/fan Replace the audio adapter Add USB flash drive Replace the speakers Replace video adapter Install external hard driver Install DVD writer Replace power supply Add\/replace hard drive Install secure wireless networking Install a video capture card Replace motherboard Upgrade processor Replace the display","7":"Keep in mind, a laptop is one unit. If you break one piece of it, then usually, the whole unit will become un-operational. This leads to the advantages of a desktop. First off, they\u2019re very difficult to steal. Not only would a thief have trouble finding the right time to break into your room, but how would they get away unnoticed? Second, unlike a laptop, if a piece on a desktop breaks, that piece is often replaceable for an affordable price. Desktops are also larger, so the keyboards are easier to type on and the monitors are easier to view. And they\u2019re faster. So, which is a better option? A lot will depend on your personality and what you feel more comfortable with. If you like to take notes by hand in class and prefer to be detached from technology at times, then choose a desktop.","8":"Linux - Linux help | No Comments Ubuntu Linux \u2013 The Best Operating System For Your Computer By Eve Wilson Are you looking for a good alternative for your Windows operating system?

Mainstream Mainstream laptops are mid-size laptops that are good in terms of performance. They come at a higher price too. These laptops are not specialised for providing better portability, but are still better than desktop replacements.

These laptops offer more value for the buck with their varied applications and uses. Nevertheless, they are not well suited for regular travellers.

With the new Audio subsystem in Vista, if you are running 5.1 or higher you can turn on your Mic and it will auto tune the speakers and environment sounds for an outstanding experience. Another great thing about Sound in Vista is that even with an old AC'97 sound card and just stereo speakers on a desktop or laptop, the sound fidelity is significantly better than XP or OS X by several factors.","19":"The stereo sound is not much different to the NEX or Alpha 55 despite being capable of 48kHz (better than CD) sampling. The microphone under its unusual top grille seems less prone to wind noise than most DSLRs; the wind noise reduction feature, a bass cut filter, is additionally effective. Body handling noise is present, so is lens focus noise. The external mic socket provides 5v phantom power for popular condensor mics, and is stereo too. No provision for fixed gain is made \u2013 auto level or gain is always on. The camera needs an option to disable auto gain so that a preamp or mic with dB cut choices can be used to control a fixed sound level; better would be three levels, like Nikon; even better still a proper sound level monitor display and full control in fine steps like Canon.","20":"Nikon's build quality and ergronomics are way ahead of canon's. Even a camera like the D40 has a much superior LCD than the 5D.Tests say the Nikon's Vibration Reduction system is better than Canon's IS system. If you are on the street and would like a dependable camera that understands you...go NIKON. Landrum Kelly , July 19, 2007; 09:10 A.M. GO NIKON! GO CANON! Nothing like objectivity. . . Shane, here is a group of guys who just might disagree with you. This is a photo of pro photographers using predominantly EOS systems at the Olympics in 2004, a very demanding situation where \"every moment counts\" (your phrase). After you have felt the full impact of the above photo, go read Bob Atkins'preview of the Canon 1D Mark III. I have to admit, however, that both the Nikon D200 and the Nikon D2x shoot more frames per second than the 5d.","21":"The extra light certainly brightens up the shadows, but the JPEG processing of the Canon has distinctly let it down by wading in and brightening it up to the extent that the brickwork is completely overexposed. The Nikon looks like it brightens just as much, but starting from a lower light level the result is better. The best outright result from an exposure perspective came from the Pentax which underexposed the RAW file, but brightened it and added just the right amount of contrast to give a near perfect JPEG file. Now, stacking the JPEGs up against each other, the Nikon file is the sharpest with more detail. The Pentax file has the most contrast, but also slightly more tonal variation in the shadows. The Canon file is the softest with the least detail, but bear in mind, the differences are very minor.","22":"Nikon D7000 or Nikon D5100 (58,430) Review: Olympus EP-3 (and 12mm F\/2) (41,513) 4 Reasons Why the Olympus EPL-2 and XZ-1 Will Dominate in Sales (36,290) ISO Torture Test: Pentax K-5 vs. Nikon D7000, which is better?

This test was done with zone metering and gave some interesting results. The first is that the Nikon has lost the sky to the right while having the darkest building front. The white balance has also given the church front a very cold feel. The white balance of the Pentax and Canon are better. The Canon has brought in more sky, so has a lighter building. However, the Pentax has a darker building than the Canon and yet also more sky, giving a slightly better dynamic range result. So, again the Pentax and Nikon produced exposures slightly more aimed at the building, the Canon took slightly more notice of the sky, but the Pentax gave the best result overall.","24":"The mosaic crop is noticeably sharper, and the pink swatch has excellent detail, and the red leaf swatch is pretty respectable. Otherwise, it's not a huge change at ISO 100 from the 5D Mark II. Canon 5D Mark III versus Canon 7D at ISO 100 Canon 5D Mark III at ISO 100 Canon 7D at ISO 100 18 to 22 megapixels isn't that large a difference, but it's clear that the 5D Mark III is able to resolve a little more detail. Canon 5D Mark III versus Nikon D4 at ISO 100 Canon 5D Mark III at ISO 100 Nikon D4 at ISO 100 Nikon's new D4 has a 16-megapixel sensor designed for greater speed and low-light performance, but it does give something away in the resolution department, at least here at ISO 100. Interestingly--and unsurprisingly--the D4 does a little better with the red leaf swatch at ISO 100, but misses the texture of the pink swatch beneath.","25":"Choices: Nikon D3x, Canon 1Ds III, Canon 5D II | Bill Lockhart Photography The Light that Dances . . .

For me, the considerations involve whether upgrading will improve the overall quality of what I do. And yes, a good camera will produce better images, even though the key ingredient is always the photographer and the photographer\u2019s skills.","26":"Now that I've been using the 5DmkII, which is my first full frame DSLR, I don't think I'll go back to crop. I'm pretty happy for now but there are areas Canon can't improve on that Nikon does. 24p is a significant difference. And the D700's AF system is much more advanced than the 5D's. I'm looking forward to a full frame 1080p, 24p, manual control, high quality codec, & 0 rolling shutter artifacts. I think NIkon can easily do this if they decide it's a priority. August 1, 2009 | Digigenic i like mjpeg, it's the low bitrate that sucks. no motion artifacts, very low system requirements. 50 mbps mjpeg would be awesome, much better than avchd or other interframe schemes for my purposes. manual control is the only thing i *really* need.","27":"(117,419) Which One?

The Nikon has four strength settings, but like the Canon, there\u2019s very little difference between them so you may as well use the highest setting. The Pentax has five settings and there\u2019s quite a big difference between them, from hardly any effect to much more aggressive reduction. Stacking all three up against each other at ISO3200 on the strongest setting, there\u2019s a case to be made that the noise reduction of the Pentax is the best because it has the worst noise and yet it makes a good job of it. The Canon noise is softer than the Nikon but is more prevalent. The Nikon reduces it to clumps so some areas look better and others worse. From a straightforward question over which image looks best at ISO3200 with the noise reduction set to maximum the answer would be the Nikon, though there\u2019s not much in it.","29":"The T3i is also more prone to chromatic aberration than the D5100. The Nikon also produces excellent images in both RAW and JPEG, and it does an even better job of keeping thenoise down at high ISOs. Best of all, it doesn't seem to share other DSLRs' tendencies to overexpose in high contrast situations. It also has better dynamic range and color depth than the Canon. In Conclusion I personally find the layout and control system of the Nikon confusing and somewhat lacking in key areas. However, image quality is where it counts, so, if you're new to digital cameras, then the Nikon has the edge. Both cameras have their plus points though, and users are unlikely to be disappointed by either machine. Suggested Reading Canon 7D Vs. Nikon D300s Canon T3 Vs.

This means, of course, that they design it to operate in a way that they would like to use. Because these people are, by definition, programmers, most of the software is tailored to be used by someone as technically proficient as a programmer. It is likely to be intimidating to someone with less skill. Furthermore, because most Linux authors receive no compensation whatsoever from an additional user using their software, there is no incentive for them to make it easier for non-technical people to use. The figure to the right shows the the value of certain operating systems as a function of the proficiency of the user. Linux does more good than something like Microsoft Windows for an expert, but it does considerably less for a non-expert.","60":"Both OpenBSD and Linux, with relatively standard and similar steps, can be made significantly more secure. It is not difficult to turn either into a secure, very narrowly purposed machine that cannot easily be used for other functions. It takes a moderate amount of work to improve the default Windows security settings to approximate Linux default security characteristics and much more to try to achieve security comparable to OpenBSD. The biggest difference between OpenBSD and Linux are the number of bugs in the underlying systems. As Linux has so many more bugs, new security exploits that take advantage of those bugs will continue to be found at significantly higher rates than for OpenBSD. As Windows appears to even more bugs than Linux, it's unlikely to ever approach OpenBSD security characteristics. Though theoretically, Windows servers have significantly longer security related feature lists than any standard UNIX system, implementation issues prevent the effective use of these features.","61":"The Old Joel on Software Forum - Is Linux more Secure Than Windows?

Security Advantage (sometimes): Some Linux distributions take security more seriously than others, but generally speaking Linux and Unix machines have been more secure than Windows. Vista's security is good, although cumbersome, and Windows 7 will probably be better. Still, because Linux is based on Unix, the directory structure was designed from the beginning with security in mind. Robustness Advantage: I mentioned the Windows Registry, which is one of the reasons that performance degrades over time when outdated entries build up.","70":"Linux is very, very secure.

Your image will begin to shift laterally around the field of view - very frustrating indeed. Small amounts of image shift are acceptable when casually viewing the celestial sky through even a moderately high-power eyepiece, but when you attach an imaging train to your SCT and try to center a guide star in your eyepiece's illuminated reticle crosshairs, etc., you find that this mild irritation has become intolerable. The image jumps all over your image plane and field of view. You have just encountered unacceptable lateral image shift. Until Meade and Celestron start building a better SCT (yes, you can eliminate the lateral image shift by simply designing and implementing a better fork-type primary focusing arm), the astroimager must use a secondary focuser docked to the SCT's visual back to eliminate the focusing wiggles.","82":"How can I stay stable while traveling or on holiday?

Though easyJet.com, Ryanair.com and RailEurope.com are relatively easy sites to use, it often takes a bit of manipulation to get the itinerary you want, especially when connections are involved. Our second lesson was that although discount airlines may be on the rise, you shouldn't dismiss the train option altogether. Particularly for itineraries where the cities aren't far apart, the train may still be your most economical and even your quickest choice. However, the more distance your itinerary covers, the more appealing a plane is likely to look (unless you're willing to consider overnight trains). You might also want to consider combining your options.

A new study compares the \"full life-cycle\" emissions generated by 11 different modes of transportation in the US. Unlike previous studies on transport emissions,Mikhail Chester and Arpad Horvath of the University of California, Berkeley, looked beyond what is emitted by different types of car, train, bus or plane while their engines are running and includes emissions from building and maintaining the vehicles and their infrastructure, as well as generating the fuel to run them. (Table 1 on page 3 has a complete list of components that were considered). Transport studies expert Abigail Bristow of Loughborough University, UK, who was not involved in the study, says it is valuable because it attempts to compare transport on equal terms. To do this, Chester and Horvath calculated how many passengers each train, plane, bus or car would carry in its lifetime and how many kilometres it would cover.","87":"What we get from this comprehensive life cycle analysis is what's indicated above. For example, the San Francisco Bay Area's electric train-transit system known as BART is responsible for substantially less carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions per passenger mile than any plane. But Boston's Green Line light rail is responsible for slightly more carbon dioxide than midsize and large aircraft, but way less nitrous oxide. Yet it almost bumps the top of the chart on sulfur dioxide emissions. If Boston were less dependent on fossil fuels, the numbers would look very different. In fact, as these researchers point out, all comparisons can change drastically if energy sources, technologies, and demographics change. You'll notice that I mentioned they also compare cars to other modes of transportation. Because of this, it seems to me that people who dwell on the train\/plane issue have got the whole thing upside down.","88":"That was cheaper than any plane ticket then. Now I can fly for less than that. The train would probably cost more. So back to my original quandary. Should we do something about rail in America or let Amtrak go the way of the dodo? I say do whatever to bring us up to the same level of Japan, China, France and Germany or leapfrog them. A modern train with right a way could do Canada to Mexico in 10 hours or less and would be full the whole way because unlike an airplane they pick up people on the way.

Myth Busted: Better to drive than fly? It depends! 25 Aug\/11 We asked the question: Is it better to drive than to fly for business or vacation travel? Surprisingly, the answer may be NO. Or more accurately, IT DEPENDS. This was an interesting and challenging question because of the number of variables involved. The answer depends on the length of your journey, how full the plane is, whether you\u2019re driving solo or carpooling, and many more factors! One of the more recent and detailed analyses I came across done by Sightline Institute actually found that the worst way to travel (for the planet) was by driving solo. This applied whether the vehicle you were driving was an SUV or an average car. The best transportation choices in this study were to hop on a bus, take a train, or to carpool with 2 other passengers.","91":"Nathanael 3:09pm | dec 29, 2009 \"Roy, what range do you think is the breakpoint for EV making ICE obsolete? You mention 800 miles in your answer to Kevin.\" Dunno about Roy, but I think the range is actually a mere 500 miles. That's 4 hours each way with a little to spare. Longer than that and there's already a better alternative to driving, most of the time (train or plane for big destinations, ATV or snowmobile for the middle of nowhere :-) ), or you can arrange charging facilities at the far end. A somewhat better 'countryside' train network would reduce the breakpoint to about 250 miles, which Tesla is already promising to be able to do reliably on the Model S. Western Europe already has a dense train network and the breakpoint there is probably more like 120 miles, which can already be achieved routinely; as soon as Europe gets mass-production electric cars the gas cars will just go away.","92":"Then add an element of surprise with games like charades or Scrabble where you make up the words and the rules.

Travel: The void-of-course Moon can be a good time to take a trip, if someone else is doing the driving. A journey by air, train, boat, or bus can be relaxing, and the time will pass easily.

There are many travel options available if you are travelling within the UK or Europe or further afield including plane, train, car or bus. So which is the best option? Travelling throughout Europe by coach has advantages and disadvantages. If you are afraid of flying then coach travel obviously gets around the concerns of flying, however, if you are travelling long distances coach travel can be time consuming, often with many connections needed and uncomfortable seats which you will be sitting in for long periods. Coaches do not offer much chance to stretch your legs. Travelling further afield than Europe by coach is not really practical. Trains are a good choice for travel throughout Europe. They are faster than cars and coaches and offer a more relaxing form of transport.","96":"And generally that\u2019s because I\u2019ve spent a little time while awake to think the shit through and find a good balance between moral ideals and day-to-day life.

Ac. Before I came to study in America, I had worked with Integrated Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Western Medicine in two municipal hospitals of Shanghai for 15 years. Now I am engaged in the family practice and preventive medicine in the San Francisco General Hospital. To provide my patients with a more effective and comprehensive service, I obtained the acupuncture license of California. As most hospitals in the USA do not integrate Traditional Chinese Medicine in their programs, several years ago, I founded a clinic integrating TCM and Western Medicine outside our hospital, serving the need of those who believe in TCM and prefer to combine it with their Western medicine treatment.","100":"\"No, I don't think so.\" RESPONSE: And these are the kind of things that must be tested to see first if the data supports the conclusions and second if it does, why it does.

Descartes declared that there are only two fundamental substances in the universe: corporeal (res extensae) and mental (res cogitantes). Patients are therefore diagnosed as sufferers from either bodily or mental diseases. Treatments are designed to correct these. Western scientific medicine has been very successful in the prevention and treatment of diseases and further successes can be expected. But millions of people are turning to complementary medicine. They are looking for treatments that do not fragment the sick person and that do not ignore the spiritual, individual and subjective sides of human life. Many people prefer a Holistic Medicine. Chinese medicine is an outstanding example of Holism. back to top Chinese Holism the meridians yin and yang Chinese holism takes different forms. It accepts a whole and integrated natural universe, pervaded by energy, called Qi; the substratum of the universe is also the substratum of human life which interacts with the natural environment.","103":"Acupuncture has also been shown to be effective for the treatment of hemiplegia, due to strokes.

Many Westerners are initially skeptical about the effectiveness of alternative medicine, but after giving it a try, are convinced of its amazing health benefits. If you choose to pursue a career in alternative medicine, you will learn to take approaches to illness that are much different from the ones you see on primetime TV emergency room dramas.

The ingredients are typically a mixture of well-known herbs and flowers or food items. Chinese people take responsibility for their own health most seriously, and the use of medicine and disease prevention forms a continuum with food and nutrition.

However, many are still highly sceptical about the use of acupuncture and prefer for it to remain far from orthodox veterinary practice. This book seeks to challenge common misgivings by showing how veterinary acupuncture works (for small and large animals), and why it should be established as an orthodox form of treatment. Written from a Western approach, rather than a traditional Chinese Medicine approach, it explains the background and history of acupuncture and includes key information on safety aspects, understanding pain and how acupuncture can help, practical aspects such as types of needles and methods of restraint, and related techniques.","119":"The discovery was made by psychologists from Queen's University Belfast, who as part of their research played with 42 pet cats for weeks on end.

A helpful addition is the full integration of copy and paste, across platforms. You can simply drag and drop files across operating systems without any file changing or reconfiguring. In the same principle the software also allows the user to transfer over their whole PC to their Mac, all their personal files, installed software, everything will be transferred saving all your investment into older machines.

Myth #2 \"There\u2019s no real difference between Macs and PCs.\" Response: There are BIG differences.

That will bode very well for Nokia smartphones. Nokia's touch screen interface will not need to be 'better' than the iPhone - nor even 'as good as' the iPhone, as long as Nokia's touch screen interface is 'good enough'. That was the lesson we learned in the PC industry with Windows vs Macintosh. The Mac was always better. Always! The early Windows versions were horrible up to Windows 3.0 in 1990, when finally Microsoft released an 'Macintosh clone' that was good enough. Not as good, but good enough. And the rest is history. Microsoft used its scale to crush Apple, even where Mac was always better. That is where we are with Symbian today. It need not be better or even as good as the iPhone.","174":"I highly suspect the majority will be functional.

By the early 1980s, those who drank exclusively Coke dropped to 12% and those who drank exclusively Pepsi had increased to 11% of the soft drink population. Pepsi decided that this increase was based on the taste of their soft drink and set out to prove their point with \"The Pepsi Challenge.\" In shopping malls, grocery stores and other public locations, Pepsi conducted blind taste tests. In these televised spots, consumers were asked to pick the soft drink they liked better, without knowing whether the cola they tasted was Coke or Pepsi. As results came in, it became apparent - Pepsi tasted better than Coke - 57% of testers chose Pepsi and only 43% chose Coke.","184":"Why does Pepsi win every taste test against Coke and yet Coke always outsells Pepsi? In 1975 Pepsi beat Coke quite easily in the original Pepsi Taste Test Challenge. Malcolm Gladwell in his 2005 book Blink proposed that the reason consumers chose Pepsi was due to it being a \u201csip test\u201d as opposed to drinking a full can. Pepsi being the sweeter product wins in a sip taste but a full can overwhelm with sugar, which is why Coke still dominates the market. Nice hypothesis Malcolm, but as Buyology proves, science beats speculation every time. In 2003, 67 people were given the test again, but this time they used the fMRI machine. The results were the same as twenty-eight years earlier. Pepsi was again the champ. The subjects were tested again but first they were told which product they were drinking.","185":"They were camped out in tents near St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, waving signs that expressed frustration about a system they felt had harmed more than helped them.

In the first three months of last year, Pepsi grew by 18 per cent only. Coca-Cola India chief executive Donald Short had announced that Coke would grow by at least 20 per cent for the whole of 1998. Coca-Cola, along with the Parle brands it acquired when it came into India -- Thums Up, Limca, and Gold Spot - continue to dominate India with a 55 per cent market share to Pepsi's 43 per cent. But in the cola segment, Coke comes a poor third after Thumps Up and Pepsi. The current summer season is the most important for the cola giants, with consumption at its peak. BATTLE OF THE BEVERAGES: PEPSI IS NOT AS PRICEY Regardless of which soda you like better though, Pepsi seems the better value than Coke right now.","188":"These are some pretty astounding results. When consumers saw which drink they were consuming, they chose Coke. If they didn\u2019t know which was Coke and which was Pepsi, though, they chose Pepsi. And what accounted for the difference? In a word: branding. In more recent research replicating these results, scientists have actually shown using neurological imaging scans that the brain actually responds differently to a blind-taste-test version of Coke, than a version of Coke where the subject sees and knows that it\u2019s Coke. In essence, the Coke brand \u2013 and the way our brain processes it \u2013 is so powerful, that we literally, biochemically and physiologically, enjoy Coke more when we can see and associate the Coke brand with the beverage that we are drinking. In other words \u2013 at least as far as the research is concerned \u2013 Pepsi actually \u201ctastes\u201d better than Coke, but doesn\u2019t taste as good as Coke plus Coke\u2019s brand value (or viewed another way,Coke has a stronger brand than Pepsi and as a result influences people's opinions of which soda tastes better - good thing they have a strong branding campaign!).","189":"During the 70s, Pepsi started a \"Pepsi Challenge\" during which it depicted in TV commercials featuring blind taste tests in which consumers would sip both Pepsi and Coke and declare which one tasted better. In Pepsi's ads (as well as private blind tests conducted by Coke) a majority of consumers tested chose Pepsi. This set off a panic which led Coke to tamper with it's #1 selling formula and come up with a new one. New Coke was born. By all scientific reasoning, New Coke should have been a hands down success. Unlike regular Coke, New Coke handily beat competitor Pepsi in blind taste tests by a wide margin. Yet New Coke ended up being an instant and unmistakable failure! Why? Gladwell explains that New Coke was built to win taste tests. To appeal to consumers who onlysipped the cola in small amounts.","190":"If I go somewhere I don't know what they sell, I order a Coke. If the waiter\/waitress asks me, \"Is Pepsi OK?,\" I make it a point to give a disappointing look, sometimes settling for water. Coke simply has better products, and Coca Cola, Co.'s superiority over PepsiCo with respect to their flagship colas is substantially comparable to the superiority the 1927 Yankees would have over the little league team I played on when was 11. (Side note: For purposes of this discussion, and really for purposes of my life, I'm ignoring that Mountain Dew and Mello-Yellow exist.) On Monday, Motley Fool writer Rex Moore reported the results of a highly scientific blind taste test atFool headquarters between Vanilla Coke and Pepsi Vanilla. The results? Out of 19 taste-testers, 68% chose the correct response, Vanilla Coke.","191":"well carbonated and not overly sugared, which is rare for a mainstream soda. Pepsi Cola, on the other hand, is for children and adults who thread their donuts with Twinkies when they\u2019re not licking their candy wrappers for the extra sugar. Additionally, this is about \u2019Coca-Cola Classic\u2019, not New Coke, Diet Coke, Diet Caffeine-Free Coke, Cherry Coke, Coke with Lemon, Diet Coke with Lime, Vanilla Coke, or whatever other poorly-conceived-of spin-off concoction they\u2019re foisting on us this week. That stuff ain\u2019t right. Graphic coming soon probably not ever. *Also note that this is a comparison of Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi Cola, and excludes all other colas, some of which are better than either. Royal Crown Cola, which is a personal favorite here at Current Config, is an example of this.","192":"Okay - so I know that soda and coke and pop and whatever is called different things in different areas. So like in one part of the US it's all soda. In another everything is called Coke. Well, here in CA I call everything \"cola\" Coke. But the servers always say, \"Is Pepsi okay?\" (Pepsi is WAY BETTER... but that's an argument better left for another day) So when you're somewhere that they call everything COKE what if it's Pepsi? Or are all establishments like Pro-Coke and Pepsi isn't allowed - and OMG RC don't even think about it! Do they still ask people in those areas if Pepsi is okay? Why do I care about this? So, apparently I have a new sense of clarity that allows me to really analyze - well, everything. So today, at the bank, I saw a lady with a weird face. Her face wasn't ugly - there was just something strange about it. So I checked out her forehead to see if it was possible that she had a five-head and that was the problem. She did have an unusually large forehead, but it was not caused by the usual strange hairline that most five-headed people have. In fact, the problem with her face was that although her head was totally normal - her face was kind of small - and it was lower on her head than it should have been. She suffered from Poor Facial Placement. Sad.","193":"As long as it is taken up at the right time. Anyway... I prefer Coke. Though both taste the same, to me, I feel that Coke had more identity as compared to Pepsi. This could be due to the advertisement that I keep on seeing on the television, newspapers and even magazine. These advertisement imprints and image in out mind that will make us want an like one brand over the other. Although I feel that some pepsi advertisemebt are great, I just feel that Coca Cola's is better. Just my thoughts. Reply Read Close 0 Responses Agree?

Bottom line: Yahoo has let Google paint Yahoo into a corner long term. Yahoo is now left with a choice of options worse than a $33 Microsoft takeover.

For an interesting look at a direct results comparison, check out this piece fromSearch Engine Land. Comparing Bing And Google Results According to several sources though, Bing may be edging ahead on the usability score, even if it\u2019s a long way behind on market share.","206":"Tip 1: Use the Right Search Engine or Database Search engines are not one-size-fits-all, and often finding the best result means starting in the right place. Don\u2019t limit yourself to using Google, Yahoo and Bing; especially for academic research these common search engines might not be the best solution. Choosing a search engine specific to your needs means you won\u2019t have to sift through pages of irrelevant results or inadequate sources during your search. Spending a little time finding the right search engine in the beginning could save you hours of searching later. Take a look at the Choosing a Search Engine Web Guide to discover search engines that specialize in delivering academic and trustworthy results, or try the findingDulcinea search engineSweetSearch for a student-safe search environment.

Being listed doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you\u2019re going to get traffic. Unless your site garners a good page rank, your traffic may remain minimal.","208":"AdSense revenue must be a factor and the deal may well offer Google the chance to gain a better insight into Yahoo! users that would be beneficial in future strategies. Richard Waters of the Financial Times voiced his concerns in a recent blog that this paid search deal with Google could come back to haunt Yahoo!, suggesting that if advertisers can buy Yahoo! inventory through Google, why wouldn't they abandon Yahoo's Panama system and just feed everything through Google's AdSense network? But thesearch engine must have taken the possibility of lost traffic to Panama into consideration when evaluating the deal - Yang stated that the deal would leave Yahoo! in a financially strong position that would allow them to invest more in Panama. And the fact that it's non-exclusive allows the recently courted search engine to enter into similar agreements with other companies.","209":"I use Yahoo less and less because it\u2019s search system continues to unhelpful for me. Google, despite its weird positioning of Google Products is getting better. My hypothesis: Google has my father\u2019s green thumb. Yahoo has my mother\u2019s black thumb (may she rest in peace). Not only does Yahoo have the uncanny ability to muff its acquisitions, Yahoo can\u2019t find penguin bracelets. Frankly I am tired of Yahoo technologists telling me that Yahoo\u2019s engineering is as good or better than Google\u2019s. I just don\u2019t buy that argument. I can\u2019t relate to black thumbs, and it is a fact that I can\u2019t buy a penguin bracelet via the Yahoo shopping search system. I can, however, buy a pink penguin bracelet, a gold penguin bracelet, and silver blue gray penguin bracelet from Google. Stephen Arnold, November 22, 2008 Written by Stephen E.

There are multiple techniques that can be used when trying to acheive higher rankings in Google local or Yahoo Local Search, but nothing beats good old fashioned Local Search Engine Optimization. Google Maps & Yahoo Local Search are a lot like their search engine counter parts with a few major differences. When Google Maps appears in the organic search results it is generally because you were searching with a geographic term such as 'Personal Injury Attorneys Los Angeles, CA', so Personal Injury Attorneys that have an address in LA and are listed on Google Maps will tend to appear higher... makes sense, right? Google cross references your business name, address, as well as your web site to determine relevancy to the search terms. Here are a few things we do for our clients to help them appear better in local search such as Google Maps & Yahoo Local Search: Make sure every address & phone number your business has is listed in Google's Local Business Center Making sure your web site is optimized for the key search terms that you are targeting Backlinks from other websites with key search term and geo keywords Making sure your website is 'Search Engine Friendly' Run paid search campaigns on Google Maps - Your business shows up on the map when keywords we target are being searched.","211":"The search engine giants Google, Yahoo and Bing put aside their rivalry and joined hands to offer better search result to users. Google, Yahoo and Bing announced the launch of a new initiative called schema.org. The motive behind the schema.org is to create and support a common vocabulary for structured data markup on web pages. With schema.org, site owners and developers can learn about structured data and improve how their sites appear on major search engines. \"Schema.org aims to be a one stop resource for webmasters looking to add markup to their pages,\" Google said in itsblog. The Schema.org provides a collection of schemas, or html tags, that webmasters can use to markup their pages in ways recognized by major search providers. Search engines including Bing, Google and Yahoo rely on this markup to improve the display of search results, making it easier for people to find the right web pages.","212":"If you ask me, I would give my vote to Google.

Still, you may not have your browser configured to provide optimum security. Take a few minutes to give Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 2 a safety check.","220":"In fact, at that time, many learning platforms (such as Blackboard) worked best with Internet Explorer. In the last few years, Mozilla has perfected Firefox to the point where more and more learning platforms and websites now work better with Firefox. For instance, Moodle (the platform we use here at Time4Writing) works better with Firefox than Internet Explorer. For instance, when using Internet Explorer, do you ever receive those pesky error messages that say Internet Explorer has had a problem and needs to be shut down? You know what happens next; you lose all the hard work you\u2019ve just completed. Grrr! However, I have been using Firefox as my primary browser for over three years now, and have never had such a problem. Firefox will also help Time4Writing students in other ways. For example, Firefox has a built in spell checker that underlines a misspelled word in red dots as soon as it is typed and has a space or punctuation placed after it.","221":"The fact that IE comes pre-installed on millions of desktop computers is the only reason that it will retain any lead at all. If the playing field were level, and if Microsoft were not a convicted monopolist, then Firefox would already have climbed to the top of the browser market. Why? Simply because it is better in all ways than Internet Explorer. Firefox loads pages faster. Firefox is far, far more secure. Firefox runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Firefox offers tabbed browsing and pop-up blocking. Firefox has hundreds of free extensions and themes to customize the experience. Firefox will improve your productivity on the web by an order of magnitude. Firefox offers everything that Internet Explorer does and a thousand things more. And moreover, Firefox gets a little bit better every single day, thanks to the passion of the open source development community.","222":"Using Firefox, I can flip quickly and easily between them. Firefox has many other features not offered by Internet Explorer, including the ability to view your browsing history not just by date but by name of website (alphabetical order), order in which last viewed, and so on. It is also much better at organising your Bookmarks (Favorites) than Internet Explorer. The best news is that Firefox is free of charge, and you can download it via the following link: http:\/\/www.nickdaws.co.uk\/firefox.htm Just click on this link and click on the button that appears to go to the main information and download page. Sorry that's a slightly roundabout method, but by following this method the website will automatically detect what software you currently have installed and take you to the most appropriate download page. This version of Firefox includes the Google toolbar, which has a pop-up blocker, automatic form filler, Google search box, spell-checker, and much more.","223":"According to the notification Mozilla Project, Google and Mozilla extended \u201csignificant and mutually beneficial deal.\u201d Under the agreement, Google will continue to be my default search engine in the browser Firefox for \u201cat least another three years.\u201d Representatives of Google, in turn, said: \u00abMozilla has been \u2026Read more \u2192 Share 123 million in profits, 2010 representatives of Mozilla, firefox, Google and Mozilla, Google will be your default Try to crack: Chrome the most secure browser, IE second, Firefox on third place December 12th, 2011 | Posted by synt4x in Security - (0 Comments) Google Chrome better than other popular browsers to protect against online threats.

Currently, there are several browsers that a student might choose, and as with everything, each has pros and cons. The two most popular browsers are Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. First, let me say that I used Internet Explorer as my browser of choice for the first eight to ten years of being online. Then, about five years ago, I came across some sites that claimed to work better with Firefox as a browser. So, wanting the best possible experience, I downloaded and started using Firefox as my preferred browser and found that it really did work better on many sites. However, being a creature of habit, I could not completely let go of Internet Explorer, and I found that many sites still worked best with it.","225":"Browser FishIE with 20 fish (FPS - higher is better) 500 Fish Internet Explorer 9 60 39 Firefox 4 60 35 Google Chrome 12 40 4 Opera 11.50 20 3 Safari 5 20 3 Another IE9 demo, Psychedelic Browsing, spins a color wheel and plays spacy sounds, reporting RPM as a result.

Download Firefox from Mozilla Chrome 7.0.517.41 beta Chrome is a newer browser from Google. It also has a great collection of extensions (like Firefox add-ons) to add functionality to the browser. It\u2019s also very secure and it has a pleasant, uncluttered user interface. The big attraction is speed. It opens faster than other browsers and will amaze you if you\u2019re still using Internet Explorer. Download Chrome from Google Other Browsers Don\u2019t count out Microsoft, though.

Another good one for Windows is Opera, available athttp:\/\/www.opera.com. You do not need to uninstall Internet Explorer; simply stop using it. As some of you may know, downloading updates from Microsoft's web site - including Windows XP Service Pack 2 - requires Internet Explorer.

Luckily today we have excellent alternatives, most notably in Firefox and (my recommendation) Google Chrome. Faced with competition and plummeting market share Microsoft are now desperately trying to catch up. But they are still miles behind. A Firefox developer recently released a comparison of Firefox with the newest version of Internet Explorer, IE9 which is due to be released later this year. The comparison shows that even the upcoming IE9 is way behind Firefox in terms of features. Google Chrome is even better than Firefox! It is faster, more stable, and has more features.

For example, the Jeep Wrangler is a very good vehicle for what it's supposed to do, but what it does well is pretty much one thing, so it isn't a great car in my opinion. Some could argue a great car has purity, so something like the Wrangleris a great car.","243":"AutoHaus | Audi A4 Outsells BMW 3 Series Home About Us Our Founder Our Dealership Message from the Owner Staff Collection Testimonials Jobs Location Download Brochure Privacy Policy Service Dept Bodyshop Parts Dept Parts Dept E-Bay Auctions Specials VW Audi Porsche Pre-Owned Credit Application (Secure) Warranty Upgrades Blog Social Facebook Twitter (Audi) Twitter (VW) Twitter (Porsche) YouTube Contact Us Service Parts Sales Bodyshop Location Let Us Help You Find What You Are Looking For New Pre-Owned Year: Make: Model: Mileage: Price Range: *First Name: * Last Name: *Email: *Phone #: We are a U.S.-based company and prefer to work with U.S.-based customers Audi A4 Outsells BMW 3 Series Posted by: AutoHaus On: 01\/20\/2009 16:10:31 In: Audi Audi A4 Outsells BMW 3 Series, Is Germany\u2019s Most Successful Premium Model in 2008\u2022 After VW Golf, Audi A4 most frequently bought car in Germany \u2022 Audi A6 and Audi TT most successful models in their classes \u2022 Audi is the premium brand in Germany and Western Europe experiencing the strongest growth The latest vehicle registration numbers verify that the Audi A4 is Germany\u2019s most successful premium automobile.","244":"The diesels are much more efficient, with the 116d the best at 64.2mpg and 118g\/km, the 118d just behind with between 50.4mpg and 62.8mpg and emissions from 119g\/km to 150g\/km.

There is an assortment of reasons to opt for gas over electric. For people concerned about the bottom line, it tends to be cheaper to operate a gas stove, depending on the type of gas used to fuel it (natural gas is the least expensive) and the prevailing prices for gas. Gas stoves tend to be a bit more expensive to buy and install, but people may feel that this is worth it when viewing costs in the long term. A gas stove offers immensely more control over what is going on at the stove top. When temperature adjustments are made with a gas stove, the stove changes immediately, rather than taking time to heat up or cool off, as is the case with an electric range.","260":"Going with gas would cost you an additional $120\/yr. Contract. PSE\u2019s deal to help cover the cost of bringing gas to your house may require you to change over your water heater and stove to gas. You may not be planning on replacing these other two appliances and doing so may cost a lot of money. Cooking does not account for a large amount of energy use, and an electric stove is about twice as efficient as a gas stove. If you want a gas stove for the better cooking experience, consider an induction stove top which is the not only the most efficient but also the top performing cooking appliance (yep, even better than gas). An induction stove top is, however, very expensive ~$2k. Cooking with gas releases more pollutants in the house and it would be best to have a better functioning kitchen exhaust fan in that scenario.","261":"Select a wok that is deep and well-rounded, made of heavy carbon-steel for maintaining good heat and for easy seasoning. Flat-bottom woks are now commonly available and though they provide good balance on flat stovetops, I still prefer the old-fashioned round bottoms. It is much easier to remove all particles of food from round woks without scraping the seasoning, enabling you to stir-fry two or more batches of food without having to clean in between batches. I use a 16\" carbon steel wok with a round bottom on a gas stove. I find that the round bottom works better with a wok shovel. A round-bottom wok may sit securely on the burners of your stove, but most likely you will need a wok ring that fits your stove well. I like the 16-inch wok better than the smaller standard 14-inch size: you can just as easily cook smaller quantities for a few people, or a feast for a larger group \u2013 that is, if your burner is hot enough to take a loaded wok (12,000 b.t.u.'s or better) If you have an electric stove, you might find that the flat-bottomed woks work better, but because the wok shovel is intended for a round-bottom, you might substitute with some other implement (such as a wooden spoon) that would not scrape off the seasoning at the corner where round sides meet flat bottom.","262":"For finicky dishes, this level of control can be critical. It's also easy to gauge how much heat a pot or pan is getting by looking at the flame, allowing for more accuracy when working with gas. Gas stoves also tend to contribute less to ambient temperatures in the kitchen. After a day of slogging over the stove, the kitchen should not be significantly warmer as a result of lost heat from the stove, a common problem with electric stoves. Gas stoves also work when the power is out, a definite plus for people in regions with unreliable power sources, and the stove top tends to be cooler than that of an electric stove, reducing the risk of burns. Historically, gas ovens have been criticized as being slightly less accurate and harder to handle than electric ovens. However, there are many modern gas stoves that offer ovens with excellent performance on par with that of an electric oven if not better, and they are often more suitable for tasks like broiling and baking bread.","263":"One type may be better than another in certain conditions and circumstances, but the bottom line seems to be that electric sauna heaters, gas sauna heaters, and wood burning sauna heaters each have unique appeal. According to sauna authority Mikkel Aaland, who wrote Sweat, a 1978 history of international bathing customs, \u201cWhether to use an electric, gas, or wood burning stove is the first decision in sauna building.\u201d And the author asserts that it\u2019s a decision that may be influenced by geographic location. \u201cIf you live in the country where firewood is plentiful and fires have minimum environmental impact,\u201d Aaland contends, \u201cthe wood burning stove is the best performer and must be considered the first choice.\u201d Few people would refute the claim that wood burning sauna stoves help to create an almost seductive ambience for the sauna bather \u2013 one of soft heat, an agreeable outdoorsy aroma, and the calming sound of a crackling fire.","264":"Put only enough water in your kettle to fill your teapot or mug. By taking care to boil only as much water as you need, you\u2019re not wasting any water, and you\u2019re not expending any more energy than necessary to bring it to the right temperature. Stick With Gas If Possible. Generally speaking, it\u2019s more energy-friendly to use a gas stove than an electric stove or AC-powered (plug-in) kettle. Gas burns more cleanly than coal (which is used to produce the vast majority of residential electricity in the United States). Natural gas is definitely not a perfect solution for all of our energy needs, but until technology and renewable energy markets develop further, it\u2019s still better than coal. * * For Electric Stove Users. If you drink your tea with a meal, use the same burner you cooked with to heat your kettle while the burner is still hot.","265":"Without the need for flues or fireplaces the Broseley Lincoln Electric Stove easily be achieves this!

While we often concentrate on the stove as the primary element of a cooking system, the efficiency of a stove is mainly determined by the heat transfer to the pot, and designing a better pot would be an easy way to make a more efficient stove. A variety of types of finned pots were built and tested. The best designs were separated out in the lab, using natural gas to simulate a wood flame. Several types of fins can be retrofit to existing pots. The better designs of finned pots performed well over a range of conditions using simulated stoves, and sometimes also with an actual wood burning stove modified to use natural gas to simulate a wood flame.","267":"Info From the mailbag: which stove is better for the environment, gas or electric?

Showing the Heat There are two main stove varieties: gas and electric. Cooks generally agree that gas is preferable. Why?

The coils of an electric stone do turn red\u2013after a long wait\u2013but it\u2019s hard to gauge the relative temperature from the color. Staring at a red coil tells you much less about the cooking temperature than does a quick glance at the size of the flame: the red only tells you that the stove is hot, nothow hot. In interface terms, an electric stove doesn\u2019t give a good indication of its temperature. Because of this, you\u2019re forced to stand with your hand over the stove, just to know that turning the knob actually did something .","274":"Exmoor Electric Stove | Yeoman Stoves Traditional Stoves Contemporary Stoves CL Stoves Bosca Stoves Boiler Stoves Traditional Boiler Stoves Contemporary Boiler Stoves Gas Stoves Traditional Gas Stoves Contemporary Gas Stoves Electric Stoves Exmoor Electric Stove Home Find a Retailer Brochures Product Registration Environmental Search Download high-res image Exmoor Electric Stove Complete operation by remote control The latest in the range is the electric version of the ever popular Exmoor stove.

It\u2019s a personal preference and while many say that gas is better (and I do love it) you can make a fine meal on an electric stove too. How do I find a good espresso\/cappuccino maker? Go to specialty stores. Try to find a place that sells more than one brand. Ask a lot of questions and try the coffee! When boiling pasta, do you salt the water? Yes. I was taught by one of my chefs to \u201cmake it taste like the sea\u201d. But that being said, if you\u2019re making a dish that has a lot of salt in it (pasta with prosciutto or pancetta, for example) then I ease up on the salt in the pasta water.","277":"Stoves Are Us - 1000's of Stoves, leading brands Stoves Are Us is a specialist supplier of Wood Burning Stoves, Log Stoves, Multi Fuel Stoves, Electric Stoves, Gas Stoves, Flueless Gas Stoves, and Boiler Stoves, as well as Range Cookers.

The truth is, AA is big enough to get preferred pricing and early slots regardless. They wield enough buying power to make any aircraft manufacturer sit up and pay attention. So it doesn\u2019t hurt for AA to talk to Airbus. Is the Airbus A320\/A321 the right aircraft? Quite possibly. The A321 will do a better job of fitting AA\u2019s requirements for a Boeing 757 replacement compared to the equivalent 737-900ER. It will fit almost all of the missions the 757 is currently serving (except for trans-Atlantic flights) and it will do it with pretty good efficiency compared to what Boeing is offering right now. Are they serious? Well, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this was both a warning shot over the bow to Boeing as well as a serious discussion. American Airlines really does need a better fleet going forward and it cannot afford to wait until 2019\/2020 to get started. The 737-800 is a good fit as a MD-80 replacement but not as a 757 replacement. Boeing\u2019s 737-900ER has worked well for Continental but I don\u2019t think it would work too well for American because of range and payload.","280":"Even better for Airbus was the enthusiasm of companies based in emerging markets, particularly China and India, which provided the impetus for deals that will secure much needed jobs in the British, German, Spanish and French factories. This success, however, certainly has not happened by chance. To emerge from Boeing\u2019s shadow and take up the position of market-leader which it enjoys today, Airbus has had to make the most of the technological expertise available in Europe as well as pursue sound development and marketing strategies both at home and abroad. Government interference, so often a hindrance to European companies forced to consider political as well as economic factors, has been to the company\u2019s advantage, allowing it to avoid the industrial action which has hampered Boeing in recent years. The story of Airbus, however, is not just one of European business acumen, but rather contains useful lessons from which the continents other companies would do well to learn.","281":"Last Updated: November 5, 2010 | Comments (2) COMMENTS (2) Mahi (USA): I am exicted to see the Boeing 747-8 aircraft. I think this aircraft will be an unique one in aerospace Industry. Posted on Nov. 10, 2010 11:30 AM CT Erwin Stoessel: Glad to know that the 747 has been reborn. I always thought the 747 was the best plane in the skies and will renew my desire to fly. The A380 Airbus will never be as good. Congratulations to Boeing. All that was needed for the original 747 was to be upgraded and updated. The best just got better. Posted on Dec. 2, 2010 11:15 AM CT SUBMIT A COMMENT Name*: Email*: Phone: Location: Comments*: We welcome your comments.","282":"So who are the players? Airbus and Boeing, of course. I\u2019m not sure I see this as either company\u2019s advantage either. Airbus will be pitching the A320\/A321 NEOs and Boeing will be pitching the 737s (new and old) and it will be tough to call this one. I think who comes out on top in this order will be determined by who has slots for earlier deliveries of the more re-engined aircraft. If Airbus has slots, it will get orders. We know that Boeing has slots but order delivery dates are somewhat murky, in my opinion. I do not look for Bombardier CSeries or Embraer E190\/195 aircraft to be ordered in this. They\u2019re smaller and Delta has that seat range covered right now. My best guess? I tilt towards this being Boeing\u2019s order. I think it might be won on price and an opportunity to get re-engined aircraft just a tad earlier than Airbus. However, I do not think that means that Airbus is out of the game on future orders whatsoever. I just think that it may come in the form of a follow on order in the next year and may well include Airbus medium to long range twin aisle aircraft as well.","283":"But, that being said, my estimates have the 737 MAX 8 beating the A320neo on operating costs all in (keeping in mind that price is a component), as well as excluding price, by 1-2% primarily because of larger size. The 321neo should have a tangible (3-5%) advantage over 737 MAX 9, and 319neo v 737 MAX 7 is a wash because both are soundly beaten by the C-Series. Michael O\u2019Leary is a master of playing the press; his words on the C919 are essentially a negotiating ploy to get lower prices from Boeing, but Boeing might not be willing to deal this time, as they don\u2019t have much margin on Ryanair NGs. Airbus and MOL aren\u2019t exactly the best of friends, and if MOL were truly serious about C919, then he\u2019d lose his very lucrative resale business.","284":"What is a good slide ?

Whether one is making photos or slides, every aviation photographer wants to make the best possible picture. What is a good photo ? It is the one that gives the most information on the individual aircraft and it's the one that satisfies the most from an aesthetically point of view. All information on the aircraft can be found on the fuselage and the tail, so be sure to take your photo from the side, in a way that all titles and the registration are fully visible, and not faded by the reflections from the sun.","285":"The latter point is a bit of an eyebrow-raiser. Reskinning the 777 would be a massive undertaking and essentially amount to an entirely new airplane.

As we were waiting for the Boeing press briefing to begin on Day 1, we remarked how dirty the Airbus A380 test plane was. A regular at air shows, the plane was parked right outside the media center. It clearly hadn\u2019t been scrubbed down for looks, with dirt streaks all over the fuselage.","286":"Airbus has no effective response to the 787 in its segment. I don\u2019t think the A330-200 is long for this world. The A330-300 could go on for a bit longer \u2013 at least until the 787-10 comes on stream. KC135TopBoom July 11, 2011 at 6:36 am | #2 Reply | Quote I don\u2019t know that there will be a B-787-10, Boeing has been riding the fence of that model. I think you are right about the A-332 not being long for this world. I think it will end production (but still be offered) within 10 years, or so. I also think Airbus will cancel the A-358, as Boeing did with the B-783. The B-77W will eventually kill off the A-333, too. But it may have to struggle against the A-3510 if Airbus improves that model to more of what the ME airlines want, not in its \u201cnew\u201d current form.

Boeing is hot right now, partly because of troubles at Airbus. Orders for Boeing\u2019s extremely popular 737 and the new 787 are pouring in. But current Boeing executives remember how the company was hot not quite a decade ago. At that time, the company accepted every order coming in the door.

The possibilities include and entirely new aircraft; re-winging the -300ER; putting new engines on; and putting a composite fuselage on the airplane. The latter point is a bit of an eyebrow-raiser.

Did Boeing just decide they no longer knew how to make airplane doors, and that's why they had to subcontract those out to France? Did the world's #1 manufacturer of landing gear just forget how to do it, and then miraculously it turns out the Brits are the best place to go if you want landing gear for a type of plane they themselves never even built? No. Boeing is the best manufacturer of this type of aircraft in the world. But along came a government consortium called Airbus who could offer financing on their planes that no private company could match because the financing came from European governments who could just print the money they needed. Boeing, in turn, figured out that the only way airlines around the world would buy their planes over Airbus is if they handed over the manufacture of the plane to the countries where these government-financed airlines were based.","297":"Boeing near $5.5 deal for 60 737 Max planes Cameron can save his premiership \u0013 by fixing Heathrow Boeing to purchase used Airbus planes in 777 deal Flight Attendant Unionists Tells Customer To Drop Dea...

One of the pro's of ASP is that, since it primarily uses VBScript, it's relatively easy to pick up the language if you're already proficient in Visual Basic. ASP support is also enabled by default in IIS, making it easy to get up and running. However, the components built in ASP are really limited, so if you need to use \"advanced\" features (like interacting with FTP servers), you'll need to buy additional components. PHP vs. ColdFusion? PHP is commonly said to be faster and more efficient for complex programming tasks and trying out new ideas, and is considered by many to be more stable and less resource-intensive as well. While ColdFusion once had better error handling, database abstraction, and date parsing, the database abstraction shortfalls were addressed in PHP 4.","320":"Hosting possibilities are mixed for both languages. ASP works with both Windows and Linux servers but will tend to fare better with the native Windows structure. Although PHP is capable of running on both server types, it naturally works much faster on Linux due to the low amount of resources needed and how much resources the operating system takes up on the server. Comparing PHP and ASP Both PHP and ASP are great solutions for most projects that need the server power and capabilities available with them. Both ASP and PHP have several tools and available options with their GUI options. PHP is capable of being installed quickly and easily with many tools server side which can include image manipulation, uploading, email systems and much more. ASP is designed to require registration of components and modules to make each tool possible. ASP will usually require paying for each component upgrade as well.","321":"Los Angeles Programmers - better esolution - PHP ASP Linux Web Programing & Development Our expert programmers and engineers have what it takes to provide your site with the best functionality.

ASP tends to be slower and can handle a low amount of requests before accessibility starts to lag and become labored on the server. PHP tends to be much faster and can handle thousands of requests before strain begins to become an issue. When connecting to a database, ASP will tend to work better with SQL Servers and Access. Although it is capable of running MySQL, it is more difficult to get working on just any server. PHP has better accessibility to MySQL and other options for database connectivity. The way to figure out which is necessary for a certain type of server can be done with some simple deliberation on the servers. If the server is Microsoft based, then the use of ASP with options such as SQL Server should be considered. On the other hand, if the server is Linux, BSD, or any form of Unix, then the use of a PHP and MySQL configuration is best suited.","323":"David is a CMS expert who specialises in drupal websites and web development.

Ingram Drupal hosting is a new concept in the internet world and has amazed all the human minds. In the beginning there was just a simple concept, web hosting. It later developed into dedicated web hosting and cheap web hosting, the technology just got better and PHP and ASP hosting services dawned on the web.

And that while VBScript is based on BASIC (BEGINNERS Allpurpose Symbolic Instruction Code)... I code too shortly in PHP to make a full analysis yet, but the complex object structues of VBScript is something I really put in question, PHP has a much easier syntax when it comes to that... One of the first things I saw was that PHP is based on C, which is one of the hardest programming languages in the world. That makes the syntax of for example the \"for\" statement less to my desire, which I like better in VBScript (ASP)... If you are an experienced C or C++ programmer, I think PHP makes automaticly the best choice out of PHP vs ASP. But I did find out in only 1 hour that the syntax of PHP gives you much less typing than ASP, that is a fact.","327":"It also comes with pre-formatted business website templates.

You\u2019ll hear many programmers around the Internet going on about how PHP is better than ASP. Usually their arguments run along the lines that because so many more people are using PHP, it is by default better.","328":"So, it depends on a person-to-person which language he or she is comfortable Database Connectivity PHP, being extremely flexible, can connect to various databases, the most popular being MySQL. ASP mainly uses MS-SQL. Conclusion Both languages have their advantages specific to users. Some would argue that both the languages have their own importance and depending on the user's requirements the language and the platform can be chosen. If we talk about developing a discussion board then ASP is equally capable but many feel the best discussion boards are developed in PHP. If a user is looking for some e-commerce application development then many would call ASP the ideal choice. This does not mean that PHP cannot provide e-commerce solutions, only that many people choose ASP. From my perspective, PHP is an all around better choice than ASP.","329":"PHP vs. ASP? PHP vs. ColdFusion? PHP vs. Perl? PHP vs. ASP? ASP is not really a language in itself, but an acronym for Active Server Pages; the actual languages used to program ASP include Visual Basic Script, JScript, and C#, among others. The biggest drawback of ASP is that it's a proprietary system that is natively used only on the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) platform. This limits its availability to Win32 based servers. There are a couple of projects in the works that allows ASP to function with other environments and webservers:\u00bb InstantASP from \u00bb Halcyon (commercial), Chili!Soft ASP from \u00bb Chili!Soft (commercial), and\u00bb Mono (open-source). ASP is said to be a slower and more cumbersome language than PHP, with less overall stability.

There are several reasons why you would choose ASP over PHP. Many programmers prefer ASP because it is easier to code (and is much less complex than .Net) \u2013 in fact if you are a beginner yourself, ASP is often the best choice because you can learn faster. It\u2019s a great choice for website owners who either want to learn how to code themselves, or who want to \u201cset it and forget it\u201d when it comes to building and launching a website.

To better gauge which between these two languages is more convenient to use, please see below table of differences. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ASP AND PHP ASP PHP ASP is from Microsoft thus it runs on Microsoft Servers alone. However it can also run on Linux provided there is an ASP-Apache installed. PHP is from Rasmus Lerdorf and it runs on Unix and Linux. ASP is built on COM based architecture which makes it run slower. PHP runs fasters since its codes are from its own memory space. In terms of cost, ASP requires a fee and can be quite expensive. You need to have a budget to run ASP. There are products that you need to purchase from Microsoft to make ASP work for you. PHP runs on Linux which is free.","333":"technologies really is the future for enterprise solutions but you\u2019re right\u2026for simple things, php and classic asp are simply better solutions. I just wrote a cute little cms in classic asp over the weekend\u2026since I\u2019m not a .net developer I can\u2019t comment on how long it would have taken\u2026 I am looking forward to getting into .net though\u2026I\u2019ll be migrating over soon Comment by Cesar \u2014 August 5, 2007 You guys are crazy. Classic ASP is so much slower to code for. I do both in my current work environment and we get so much more done much more quickly under ASP.Net than we do Classic ASP. That and ASP.Net runs better on the server and play nice with your database request bandwidth. Refusal to move to ASP.Net is a career death wish if you want to stay with the Microsoft platform. You do know that with Server 2008 IIS is no longer configured standard to run ASP code right?","334":"That makes the syntax of for example the \"for\" statement less to my desire, which I like better in VBScript (ASP)...

Many people who purchase fake Christmas trees do so because they believe that cutting down real trees is bad for the environment. However, \"most Christmas trees are grown as crop and replanted, so it is really no different than harvesting corn,\" Chastagner explained. \"There is natural reseeding of trees in forests and permits are given out to cut down Christmas trees in areas that need to be thinned.\" The National Christmas Tree Association also stresses how the use of real Christmas trees is actually better for the environment than fake trees. According to research, most fake trees are only used 6 to 9 years before they're disposed. Even if you would use one for 20 years or more, it will eventually be thrown away and end up in a landfill, unlike real trees, which are biodegradable and recyclable.","342":"It raises a good question: Which is better for the environment, a real tree or fake one? A festive Christmas tree is a big part of the holiday tradition. This year, Kaylee Johnson is going back to a real tree. But she cares about the environment and worries that buying a real tree isn\u2019t the right thing to do, but guess what; she\u2019s wrong. WBZ-TV\u2019s Joe Joyce reports Jeff Weigl of the Nature Conservancy says although 30 million trees are harvested every year at Christmas, it\u2019s not as bad as it sounds. Buying real trees keeps tree farms in business, and their lands covered in forests instead of development. As for artificial trees, 90 percent of them are imported from China so overseas shipping adds to the carbon foot print \u2014 and they can\u2019t be recycled.","343":"Real Or Fake Christmas Trees: What\u2019s Better For The Environment? \u00ab CBS Boston 51\u00b0 Buy Tickets Order Food More Channels Buy Tickets Order Food Your Home Daily Deals 50% off Tea District Buy Team Gear New England Patriots Critical Victory V T-Shirt - Ash Events Pat Benatar Facebook Twitter Follow Us Home News Sports Health Boston\u2019s Best Events Watch + Listen Traffic Weather Directory Deals Autos Local Politics Business Health Consumer News Tech Entertainment Blogs National World Local Real Or Fake Christmas Trees: What\u2019s Better For The Environment?

Artificial Christmas trees can be set up much earlier and left up longer. Buying artificial helps prevent the cutting down of a live tree. Artificial trees are safe and flame retardant. Coarse needles will never prick you; so artificial trees are easier to decorate. The needles on your artificial tree will never shed. Artificial trees have a fuller, classier look. They also last for years, which makes them more economical. Do you really need a real tree to decorate your living room? Is it right to cut down a living tree just because it looks and smells better? There are a variety of arguments for and against buying a live or an artificial Christmas tree. Indeed, there are good and bad things about each type of tree.","345":"Learn more about the quarantine. Who decided to make a fake Christmas tree? Actually fake trees were invented by a company who made toilet bowl brushes, the Addis Brush Company. Regardless of how far the technology has come, it's still interesting to know the first fake Christmas trees were really just big green toilet bowl brushes. Read the article. Are fake trees really fireproof?

Some reason that using the same old plastic Christmas \"tree\" is better for the environment. Should we feel guilty about enjoying a real tree? In the spirit of Francis Church, there is only one response. \"Yes, Virginia, it's OK to use a real Christmas tree!\" After all, the Christmas tree reminds us in the dead of winter of the beauty of nature and life. That can't be done with a big plastic brush. A fake \"tree\" was never alive. It never provided a perch for a bird or had a butterfly rest on its branches. A deer or bear never brushed past it. It never felt the pull of the sun to make it break bud and grow.","347":"By Jeremy, on December 10th, 2011 CarbonSync\u2122 is proud to offer carbon-neutral Christmas trees, with some proceeds going to the Society.

It\u2019s still got a few years of use left in it, so I\u2019m going to keep assembling and taking it down until it croaks. Then I\u2019m switching to real trees, because fake ones can have some pretty nasty ingredients in them, such as PVC and even lead. Plus there\u2019s the environmental impact of manufacturing and shipping the trees. If you purchase a fake tree, make sure it\u2019s a sturdy one that will last for quite some time so it\u2019s worth the impact on the environment. Are real, cut Christmas trees more your style? If so, look for organic tree farms near you or ask around for vendors of sustainably grown trees in your area. And read up onSierra Club\u2019s tips for buying and giving holiday trees.

The Green Christmas Tree Debate skip to main | skip to sidebar A Blog by Jonathan Low Dec 10, 2011 Fresh vs Fake? The Green Christmas Tree Debate You know its a trend when it gets its own lobbying group in Washington. And the numbers suggest that consumers have already made a decision at which traditionalists cringe: last year Americans bought 50 million artificial trees versus 30 million real ones. The battle of real vs fake is on - and both are using the environment as their primary argument. Fake tree supporters claim they are saving trees and that recycling theirs is better than throwing out fresh ones every year. Real tree advocates claim that encouraging farmers to grow trees is the healthier sustainable choice and that the combination of toxic chemicals and energy usage necessary for manufacturing the fake ones cancels out any possible benefits.","351":"Christmas Trees: Real or Fake, Which is Better?

Overloaded electrical outlets and faulty wires are the most common causes of holiday fires in residences - these are just as likely to affect artificial trees as Real Trees. See below for examples: Lights on Christmas Tree Spark KC House Fire Giving Tree Fire Damage $1 Million Are fake trees better for the environment? As mentioned before, most artificial trees are manufactured in China and contain PVC (polyvinyl chloride). In fact, artifical Christmas Trees were recently added to theCenter for Health, Environment & Justice's list of household products containing PVC. According to the Children's Health Environmental Coalition, the manufacture of PVC creates and disperses dioxins, which include the most toxic man-made chemical known. Released into air or water, dioxins enter the food chain, where they accumulate in fatty tissues of animals and humans, a potential risk for causing cancer, damaging immune functions and impairing children's development.","354":"But the real trees aren\u2019t going down without a fight.

And at the forefront of the argument is which kind of tree is better for the environment. For a symbol of yuletide cheer, the tree brings out some pretty hostile rhetoric. One side\u2019s Web site says fake Christmas trees were invented as oversize \u201cgreen toilet brushes.\u201d The other\u2019s claims that \u201cafter two weeks of being indoors, a live Christmas tree emitted significant amounts of mold spores.\u201d Each side offers what it considers compelling evidence.

I've been learning Java for little over a year now and I would like to share my opinions about them. I use both Eclipse and Netbeans, for two different purposes. Tried IntelliJ and Oracle JDeveloper once, but JDeveloper is slow even in my PC (C2Q Q9550 2.83GHz, 4GB, Intel G45).

I\u2019ve said before that NetBeans 6 is an important release for the NetBeans team and I believe it is one of (if not the) best IDE\u2019s available for Java, Ruby and Ruby on Rails amongst others like the upcoming JavaFX. Reasons why I like NetBeans 6: The UI is polished and extremely useable. The plugin interface is much better than the one in Eclipse. Getting the latest version is a very simple excercise and there are not 50 different versions to have to decide from. (try looking for the WTP edition of Eclipse for example). It has a much better way of managing application settings \u2013 more like a normal app not one set per workspace.","361":"because setting preferences is difficult in eclipse? or because netbeans was created with java in mind? AFAIK eclipse was also designed with java development in mind. I am a long time user of Eclipse and ex netbeans user and I have to disagree with your arguments. setting preferences is straightforward and java development support is great. the feel you get while developing is also not as bloated and \u201cold car\u201d as you say http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dootzky Dusan Nedeljkovic from my perspective \u2013 Eclipse is slow, too bloated, and clumsy. Netbeans is better. But both of these are far from \u201cthe best IDE\u201d. I love open source, and my current choice is Netbeans, but I\u2019m constantly searching for better and faster native aps (for linux or windows), which are not slow and clumsy as these two Jens No\u2026 I will certainly not go back to Netbeans.","362":"So I'm gonna post some opinions about Eclipse and Netbeans focusing on some specific criteria. Speed Well, many of us are under the impression that Eclipse is faster. That however, is arguable. In slower machines Eclipse works much better. I did some test on my own with both of them. The basic Netbeans Java package is slower than the basic eclipse J2EE package. But the reason for this is probably because Netbeans loads a lot more plugins than Eclipse does. The full Netbeans package is 380MB with all the bells and whistle, which supports pretty much anything out of the box, but the full Eclipse package (Eclipse doesn't have an official full package, so created a package with similar functionalities as Netbeans full package), well, about 1.3 GB. And if you try to load Eclipse with that many plugins, It'll eat up about 1 GB of memory instantly, and the loading time is, well, I've never managed to load Eclipse, because it crashes.","363":"This time NetBeans 6.0 won me over.

My students who used Borland's JBuilder previously, were equally impressed. For me, NetBeans now works and I have encouraged my colleagues to consider using it for their teaching!

Having been around since 1992, OpenGL is today'sde-facto industry standard 2D and 3D graphics API. OpenGL was initially developed by Silicon Graphics Inc., but is today available on a wide variety of platforms: from the low- and middle-end to the very high-end. Another well-known 3D API is Microsoft's Direct3D, the 3D part of said company's DirectX family of (primarily) game development APIs. Direct3D enjoys great support from PC graphics hardware manufacturers, but is only available on Microsoft operating systems, i.e., Windows 95\/98\/(NT\/2000). Other APIs like 3dfx's Glide, AutoDesk's Heidi, and Apple's and QuickDraw3D exist, but are not as widespread in use. Verse is not bound to a specific API or not even to the basic technique of drawing 3D, but could be ray-traced, scanlined, or even rendered with voxels.","383":"Along with the Firefox implementation, a WebGL implementation landed in WebKit fairly recently. All of these implementations are going to have some interoperability issues for the next little while, as the spec is still in flux and we\u2019re tracking it at different rates, but will hopefully start to stabilize over the next few months. If you\u2019d like to experiment with WebGL with a trunk nightly build (starting from Friday, September 18th), all you have to do is flip a pref: load about:config, search for \u201cwebgl\u201c, and double-click \u201cwebgl.enabled_for_all_sites\u201d to change the value fromfalse to true. You\u2019ll currently have the most luck on MacOS X machines or Windows machines with up-to-date OpenGL drivers. We still have some ways to go, as there are issues in shader security and portability, not to mention figuring out what to do on platforms where OpenGL is not available. (The latter is an interesting problem; we\u2019re trying to ensure that the API can be implementable on top of a non-GL native 3D API, such as Direct3D, so that might be one option.) But progress is being quickly made.","384":"Gamers on Linux are used to there being a limited choice of 3D APIs. OpenGL is an excellent cross-platform solution, but a lot of development these days are on Direct3D \u2013 which is from Microsoft and obviously not on Mac OS X or Linux. Well, not on Linux until this week. Luca Barbieri made a commit with news of native Direct3D 10\/11 support into Gallium, with an eventual goal of running Windows games in Wine. \"The primary goal is to realize Gallium's promise of multiple API support, and provide an API that can be easily implemented with just a very thin wrapper over Gallium, instead of the enormous amount of complex code needed for OpenGL,\" wrote Barbieri. \"The secondary goal is to run Windows Direct3D 10\/11 games on Linux using Wine.\" He added, \"Thanks to a very clean and well-though design done from scratch, the Direct3D 10\/11 APIs are vastly better than OpenGL and can be supported with orders of magnitude less code and development time, as you can see by comparing the lines of code of this commit and those in the existing Mesa OpenGL implementation.\" For those worried that Direct3D 10\/11 won't have the same kind of performance as OpenGL, Barbieri said, \"Finally, a mature Direct3D 10\/11 implementation is intrinsically going to be faster and more reliable than an OpenGL implementation, thanks to the dramatically smaller API and the segregation of all nontrivial work to object creation that the application must perform ahead of time.\" Read more at Phoronix.","385":"DirectDraw is like the graphical component of SDL, but the direct video card access is done by DRI rather than SDL.

Whereas OpenGL is open source, lower level and compiles under a multitude of operating systems, D3D is proprietary, higher level and only compiles on Windows.

Soon Microsoft and SGI will release their next-generation 3D API, code namedFahrenheit. Fahrenheit will introduce a new low-level rendering API, FLL, which will replace Direct3D, but will sit next to OpenGL which will continue to be developed.

There are many standards bodies:ISO, ANSI, W3C, etc. and many competing standards that find their own niches. As examples in the 3D Web space, Microsoft developed Direct3D as a Windows-proprietary 3D graphics standard, and OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) has emerged as a competing open source standard. Direct3D currently leads OpenGL in video games (both have major share), but OpenGL has developed a clear lead for academic research and scientific visualization, as well as for non-Microsoft platforms. A range of open (Scalable Vector Graphics ), semi-open (Java) and proprietary (Adobe Flash, Microsoft's DirectX 10, MS Vista'sWindows Presentation Foundation, XAML, and Dassault and Microsoft's 3D XML) 3D web enhancement standards are in competition, and each has taken many years to develop.","390":"DirectSetup This API provides a way to install DirectX from within an application to simplify game installation. Depending on the version of DirectX you're talking about, DirectX support in winex (Section 10.5.3) ranges from well supported to \"kind of\" supported. It's poorly supported by wine (Section 10.5.1), barely supported by vmware (Section 10.5.5) and unsupported by Win4Lin (Section 10.5.4). One comment about portability: Each component of DirectX has multiple corresponding library on Linux. Moreover, a game writer who uses libraries like OpenGL, GGI or SDL will write a game which will trivially compile on Windows, Linux and a multitude of other OS's. Yet game companies persist using DirectX and therefore limit their audience to Windows users only. If you're a game writer, please consider using cross platform libraries and stay away from DirectX. A company named realtechVR started an open source project, DirectX Port, <http:\/\/www.v3x.net\/directx> which, like wine, provides a Direct3D emulation layer that implements Direct3D calls.","391":"Like pretty much everyone else who isn't a Microsoft employee, I do wish Microsoft would have adopted OpenGL as the sole hardware graphics standard instead of running off and creating their own thing and creating yet another obstacle to porting games over to different platforms (and to be clear, there are MANY more issues to porting games to different platforms than I\/O APIs, for some reason I'll never understand that point is lost on a lot of people), but painting game developers who use DirectX as corporate Microsoft shills isn't the most honest or productive characterization of why things are the way they are. What is productive is looking at the technical flaws present in OpenGL and rectifying them, which is something the Khronos ARB Working Group has done an excellent job of. As far as id is concerned, Carmack is using the Direct3D-only Xbox 360 as his benchmark development platform at the moment (you can go back to his Quakecon 2005 speech for a reference on that).","392":"The community is always happy to help.

It uses OpenGL which at the moment is equal to Direct3D (DirectX). This engine is good for: People who want to develop games with Java People who are new to the game development scene This engine is not good for: People who want a bleeding-edge game engine (This engine is free after all.. if you need it then you will have to pay) People who are proficient with C++ and have no knowledge of Java.","393":"Half-Life had software, OpenGL, and Direct3D. Quake 2 had software, OpenGL, and I think PowerVR or something. Unreal had a heck of a lot of different renderers, I know software, D3D, Glide, and OpenGL were among them. They did this because driver performance and compatibility was such a big issue back then, by writing to more than one API they could cover all the bases (card X doesn't run GL well but does run D3D well? Then we support that scenario. Card Y runs D3D poorly but does GL well? We support that, too). At the end of the day, the major graphics vendors ended up putting out really excellent D3D drivers and that helped the API out significantly. D3D was the only hardware-agnostic solution back then aside from OpenGL (ATI wasn't implementing Glide), and the API mapped to the general hardware case well enough that it was relatively easy for most vendors to write good drivers for.","394":"if you want to use steam buy windows... i could be apple all i want to put android on their iphone but that doesn't mean it will happen willgart 09\/27\/2010 2:43 AM Hide - 2 + doorspawn : What we need is more competition, a newcomer 3D API (or many of them), designed from scratch.

The former is simply more fun than the latter. Don't get me wrong, there _is_ stuff out there that does work better than MS's stuff, but that one too wasn't written in a day or two.) You also face the issue that, traditionally, most graphics cards have been optimized for DirectX, since that's what the lion's share of the market uses. Traditionally, Nvidia tends to do well in OpenGL too, ATI less so. (Plus, if you actually plan to port it to Linux, there ATI's drivers traditionally are an inside joke. Not a funny one, either.)

You don't. OpenGL does not provide any interface for accessing this memory directly. You can get access to the contents of those buffers by using glReadPixels() but it is slow. There has been much debate over whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, but the reasons are basically irrelevant. You can't get direct access through OpenGL. Access to these buffers belongs in the windowing system (through DirectDraw or something similar) and not in OpenGL.","398":"The feature set of Direct3D is derived from the feature set of what hardware provides.

When the two companies began discussing this potential collaboration, they discovered how quickly they were able to find common ground. \"By working together, we will be able to serve our customers with the very best affordable, advanced powertrains, delivering even better fuel economy,\" said Ford President and CEOAlan Mulally. \"This is the kind of collaborative effort that is required to address the big global challenges of energy independence and environmental sustainability.\" Toyota President Akio Toyoda added: \"Toyota is extremely proud to join Ford in developing a hybrid system for pickup trucks and SUVs.","415":"Benchmarking Toyota Gm And Ford TX Austin Vehicle Benchmarking Toyota Gm And Ford Company, 2007 Infiniti G35 Sedan Leasing.

Similarly HRM practices work towards promoting the four goals of employee integration with the organisation; employee commitment; workforce flexibility and adaptability; and, finally, an emphasis on quality. Even though Toyota follows the widespread Japanese traditions of uniforms, common parking plots, common canteens and equal treatment of all workers, there is a clear demarcation between managers and workers. Hierarchical levels, even though they are far lesser than at Ford are clear, and responsibilities of all parties spelled out clearly. The HR formula at Toyota is simple and clear; hire the right people, pay them well, take good care of them, and develop them to work in sync with Toyota\u2019s needs.

Regards, John Kirk Tuck , October 23, 2008; 01:42 P.M. John. The camera had the latest firmware and frame lines. I used my Dual Range Summicron on it without any issues. I've never been a fan of shooting Raw+jpeg as I end up just using the raws in most cases. Kirk Author: Minimalist Lighting Arne H. Heeringa , October 25, 2008; 07:51 P.M. Great article, though I might prefer the R-D1s because of its price. I've tried a Sigma SD10 which is kind of a no-nonsense camera with some good features like seeing more in the viewfinder than the actual frame only, like Leica. I gave it up in favour to my Nikon F2 and Nikkormat FTN because of it's bad AF, terrible battery life, bad AWB and bad lens.","420":"I doubt if the D2 bashers are not not guilty of succumbing to some premium brand name items. The premium demanded by Leica was not earned in one day. If the D2 is disappointing in quality, then Leica will have much to lose. There are obviously disparate views on the Digilux 2. I do have a question that perhaps someone could answer. The D2 won the DIMA contest. Does that lend some credibility to this camera or are the DIMA judges just nincompoops? Also, for those in favor of film Leica cameras but not the D2, can't you take good photos with other fine, cheaper film cameras (Nikon, Canon, etc., ) -- why Leica? I have never owned a Leica before but I do understand its appeal. My main reason for buying the D2 is that I know each photo I take with this camera will feel special...a word I would hardly use for cameras such as Nikon D70, Minolta A2, etc.","421":"His photographs are included in a number of private collections, as well as the permanent collections of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Mexico City, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Monterey Art Museum, the Berkeley Art Museum and the Museum of Modern Art in Nanao Japan.

I personally prefer Nikon - they aren't better quality, they aren't better built, they aren't more reliable...... they aren't better anything to be honest I just prefer the overall design, handling and texture of their pro bodies. I always have and likely always will - if I won the Lotto I would, given a choice of ANYTHING, still raid Nikon's catalogue. Another way of looking at it is this: There is no such thing as a bad camera, actually there is no such thing as a camera that isn't capable of fantastic photographs. Some of the best photographs I've seen in recent years have been taken on a phone. They're not the best quality but that is irrelevant - honestly it just doesn't matter what pixels you have, what ISO you can use, what the lens cost, how many features your camera has, it all boils down to how good the person behind the lens is.","423":"(Source: Nikon.)

Although the body dimensions of both models are the same, the D300S is approximately 15 grams heavier than its predecessor. Factors contributing to the additional weight could be the second card slot (which adds support for SD and SDHC media to the D300's CF card storage) plus any additional electronics for video recording. The dual card slots, a new addition in the D300s. (Source: Nikon.) As well as giving users the option to choose the type of memory card they prefer, the additional card slot provides greater shooting flexibility and convenience. Photographers can nominate one slot as a \u2018primary' recording slot and set recording in three different ways when both slots are in use. \u2018Overflow' recording directs image data to the secondary card automatically when the primary card is full.","424":"I could live with that for a ultra wide. The screw on 20 or 21mm accessory lens is a colossal inconvenience; I had one on a Konica Minolta A2. What are the engineers thinking?7) Still no 100% optical view finder. I HATE holding the camera at arms length to aim it: think camera shake and discrete image-making. Perhaps I speak for my colleagues when I contend we would prefer a true, 100% optical view finder. The ancient Nikon SP range finder film camera had one, the Leica has one. To fix these objections, the camera might have to be larger, but it would be a real photography tool.

For speed, convenience, and cost, digital. For getting back to the roots of photography, film. On the camera I chose I first thought about shooting medium format, but then decided to work with gear compatible with my digital gear. The Nikon N2020\/F501 SLR is something I bought because of its features. It works with the F mounts lenses I use with my Nikon D90. When it originally came out, the Nikon N2020 was a decently priced entry-level film camera with dual auto focus. Since it isn\u2019t too advanced, the was familiar enough for me as a digital user to get the hang of it. Nikon 50mm f\/1.8 D For my first foray in to SLR film photography, I chose the 50mm because I am comfortable with it, and I have only used it digitally.","430":"Opt for the 28-105USM. The N70 lacks DOF and multiple exposure. The interface is more criptic and the camera is heavier (N70). Some diehard Nikon fans call that an advantage (a heavier camera).

I just recieved an Elan II for christmas. I absolutely love it. Took it hiking with me and it was great, lightweight and easy to use quickly.

Capture NX is a great program, and, because it\u2019s made by Nikon, does far better with some Nikon raw files than Camera Raw does.

The newer D3S isn\u2019t as revolutionary, but simply continues the good fight with various refinements that make it essentially a better D3. These improvements may not, at first, seem to be giant leaps forward, but any advances of DSLR capabilities at this level are likely to be viewed as jumping a chasm to the photographers who need what the D3S delivers. 2.

Make it healthier by using substitutes like olive oil instead of butter or vegetable oil, wheat flour instead of white, low fat cheeses, etc. Always use fresh herbs, garlic and spices to make the dish more flavorful. Avoid recipes that are deep fried. You know what\u2019s not food for you! 2. Create the interest by blending flavors across cuisines. Grab a starch from one country and add a sauce from another. Try a thai red curry with penne pasta, then add shrimp or chicken depending on what your family prefers. Top chicken tikka masala on a flat bread or pizza. Serve a gazpacho with shells or macaroni pasta for a delicious & healthy meal. Read more on fusion cooking. 3. Presentation is key.","448":"If you simply can't get your children to eat anything other than their favorite foods, like boxed macaroni and cheese, french fries, pizza, and cereal, don't fight it. Instead, try and improve the nutritional value of those foods and partner them with some other less favorite food disguised as 'kid friendly'. Macaroni and Cheese To make this favorite food healthier, substitute skim milk for whole milk and use trans-fat-free margarine for the butter. Serve fruit on the side. Try Earth's Best Sesame Street Elmo Mac 'n Cheese with Carrots and Broccoli. Or introduce your child toEarth's Best Sesame Street Frozen Cheese Ravioli.

Can't go to a place that specializes in pizza and pasta and not try it! So I sacrificed and had theSpaghetti Bolognese. Although the pasta was not exactly al dente, it was far from being overcooked. There was an overwhelming onion taste to the sauce. So much so, that was all I could taste. Now, it wasn't a bad onion flavour. In fact, I enjoyed my pasta. It just wasn't balanced. On top of this, I shared a Hawaiian Pizza with Gordo. Trying to be healthier (HA!), we went for the whole wheat crust. This was pretty much a solid pizza.

Although pasta appears healthier when spinach, tomatoes or other vegetables are added to plain pasta dough, the amount consumed for each serving provides little more than a coloring since the pasta will only contain about one teaspoon of vegetables. AddingPersonalized Supplements is always a good idea to make sure you are not missing any nutrients. What each family mixes with pasta is as unique as pizza toppings.

Some general rules for choosing healthy meal options include: 1. Look for the Heart Mark The Heart and Stroke Foundation (HSFSA) has joined forces with some restaurants to include healthier meal options that are lower in fat, cholesterol and salt, and higher in fibre. The aim is to identify items on the menu which already meet the dietary guidelines recommended by the HSFSA and to offer suggestions on making small changes to menu items to make them more heart-friendly. All you have to do is look for the Heart Mark symbol on menus. The following restaurants have taken part in this: Spur Steak Ranches, Panarotti\u2019s Pizza Pasta, Mochachos Chicken Villages, Morituri Pizzeria, Col\u2019Cacchio Pizzeria, St Elmo\u2019s Woodfired Pizza, Osumo and Blow Fish.","457":"How tough was that?

I don\u2019t eat a lot of pasta and pizza either, but I overdose on breads and sweets. Now I realize the importance of cutting down on those things. What are you teaching your kids about diabetes? First, they see what we\u2019re doing for Grandpa and know he can\u2019t eat certain things. They\u2019re starting to understand some foods might not be healthy. So we\u2019re cutting out some unhealthy foods like macaroni and cheese when we eat out. Instead, I\u2019ll make a healthier version at home by mixing eggs into hot pasta and use the heat of pasta to cook the egg with a tiny bit of low-fat cheddar and butter.","458":"This is a much healthier option than visiting them rit??

These so-called antipyretic agents include acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and aspirin. All three of these over-the-counter drugs appear to be equally effective at reducing fever. However, because aspirin may cause or be associated withReye syndrome, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend using aspirin to treat a simple fever in children. Acetominophen can be given without a doctor\u2019s advice once your child is older than three months, and ibuprofen can be given to children older than six months of age. However, if your child has kidney disease, asthma, an ulcer, or other chronic illness, ask your doctor first if ibuprofen is safe.","460":"These help to lower a high fever, but will not cure it. Acetaminophen should not be used if the person with a fever has liver disease. Adults may take 2 extra strength tablets (totaling 1000 mg) every 4-6 hours. Children should seek medical advice. Ibuprofen is safe for children over 6 months in age, though medical advice should be sought regarding proper dosage. Adults may take 2-3 200mg tablets every six hours. Aspirin should NOT be used with children or adolescents, due to concerns with a serious illness called Reyes Syndrome. Aspirin is, however, safe for adults. Home Remedies There are various home remedies that, while they will not cure the underlying illness, will help the fever run its course, and make a person suffering from a fever feel better Stay hydrated.","461":"Do not put anything into his mouth, not even a finger. Call your child's doctor. Your child's doctor will want to check your child, especially if it is his first seizure. It is important to look for the cause of the febrile seizure. How to reduce a fever with medicine Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are safe and effective medicines for reducing fevers. They do not need a prescription and are available at grocery stores and drugstores. However, keep the following in mind: Ibuprofen should only be used for children older than 6 months. It should not be given to children who are vomiting constantly or are dehydrated. Do not use aspirin to treat your child's fever. Aspirin has been linked with side effects such as an upset stomach, intestinal bleeding and, most seriously, Reye syndrome. If your child is vomiting and cannot take anything by mouth, a rectal suppository may be needed.","462":"There are also medications which can reduce a fever: acetaminophen and ibuprofen are safe and effective in proper doses, although ibuprofen should only be used for children older than 6 months of age, and not given to children who are vomiting constantly or are dehydrated. Aspirin should not be given to children under the age of 16 as use in children has been known to cause side effects such as an upset stomach, intestinal bleeding and, most seriously, Reye syndrome. If the child is vomiting and unable to take medication, then the pediatrician may recommend an acetaminophen suppository. A pediatrician should be consulted before giving any medication to a child under 2 years of age. An alternative way of reducing fever in children is through sponging with lukewarm water, as the evaporating water on the skin can reduce the body temperature. A pediatrician may recommend this if the child\u2019s temperature is above 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C); if the child is vomiting and unable to take medication; or if the child has had a febrile seizure in the past.","463":"Generally, children over 6 months old who have a fever of less than 101\u00b0F\/38.3\u00b0C do not need to be treated for fever, unless the child is uncomfortable. To make the child more comfortable, try to keep the room cool, keep the child dressed in light clothing, encourage the consumption of fluids (water, diluted fruit juices, or commercially prepared oral electrolyte solutions), and ensure that there is no overexertion. There are also medications which can reduce a fever: acetaminophen and ibuprofen are safe and effective in proper doses, although ibuprofen should only be used for children older than 6 months of age, and not given to children who are vomiting constantly or are dehydrated. Aspirin should not be given to children under the age of 16 as use in children has been known to cause side effects such as an upset stomach, intestinal bleeding and, most seriously, Reye syndrome.","464":"Pain Relievers There are dozens of pain-relief products. Most contain either aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen. These three drugs, as well as naproxen, relieve pain and reduce fever. Aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen also relieve inflammation. They belong to a class of drugs callednonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). When you buy pain relievers, keep in mind that generic products are chemically equivalent to more expensive brand-name products, and they usually work equally well. Aspirin Aspirin is widely used for relieving pain and reducing fever in adults. It also relieves minor itching and reduces swelling and inflammation. Aspirin comes as adult-strength (325 mg) or low-dose (81 mg). Although it seems familiar and safe, aspirin is a very powerful drug. Aspirin precautions Keep all aspirin out of children's reach.","465":"Remember, the goal is to lower, not eliminate, the fever. Here are some guidelines for taking medicine to lower a fever: \u2022 Paracetamol and ibuprofen help reduce fever in children and adults ( always ask your pharmacist if you have any underlying medical conditions) \u2022 Paracetamol can be taken every 4 - 6 hours and ibuprofen every 6 - 8 hours. DO NOT use ibuprofen in children younger than 3 months or weighing less than 5kg. \u2022 Aspirin is very effective for treating fever in adults. DO NOT give aspirin to children under age 16. \u2022 Always check the instructions on the package. In children under 3 months of age, call your doctor first before giving medicines.

Do NOT use cold baths, ice, or alcohol rubs. These cool the skin, but often make the situation worse by causing shivering, which raises the core body temperature. Here are some guidelines for taking medicine to lower a fever: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help reduce fever in children and adults. Sometimes doctors advise you to use both types of medicine. Take acetaminophen every 4 - 6 hours. It works by turning down the brain's thermostat. Take ibuprofen every 6 - 8 hours. DO NOT use ibuprofen in children younger than 6 months old. Aspirin is very effective for treating fever in adults. DO NOT give aspirin to a child unless your child's doctor tells you to.","467":"Acetaminophen and ibuprofen do not interact with each other. They may be equally effective in lowering a temperature. At different times, it may seem that one will work better than the other, or neither will work, or both. If your child has a pre-existing medical condition or is already taking other medicines, talk to your child's doctor to make sure that acetaminophen or ibuprofen is safe for your child. Do not use ASA (Aspirin) to treat your child's fever Although rare, ASA (acetylsalicylic acid or Aspirin) has been linked to a severe condition called Reye's syndrome. Do not give ASA to a child to manage a fever unless your doctor has specifically told you to give it. You may need to check the label of other medicines or ask your pharmacist to make sure that they do not contain ASA.","468":"On the other hand, acetaminophen causes less stomach upset. Ibuprofen, sold under the brand-names Advil and Nuprin, was introduced as a nonprescription pain reliever in 1984. It works like aspirin to block both fever and swelling and may work better against certain types of pain, like menstrual cramps. But even aspirin alternatives aren't entirely safe. Both can cause overdose -- and, in recent years, each has surpassed aspirin as a cause of hospitalization. And both acetaminophen and ibuprofen appear to damage kidneys with regular use. Some reports have even linked ibuprofen to a reversible, temporary form of kidney failure in as many as a quarter of patients studied. Should none of these over-the-counter drugs satisfactorily reduce discomfort, pain may be a sign of a more serious problem warranting a doctor's attention.","469":"Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever in children. Sometimes doctors advise you to use both types of medicine. In children under 3 months of age, call your doctor first before giving medicines. Know how much your child weighs, then always check the instructions on the package. Take acetaminophen every 4 - 6 hours. Take ibuprofen every 6 - 8 hours. Do NOT use ibuprofen in children younger than 6 months old. Do NOT give aspirin to children unless your child's doctor tells you to use it. A fever does not need to come all the way down to normal. Most children will feel better when the temperature drops by even one degree. A lukewarm bath or sponge bath may help cool a fever. It works better if the child also receives medicine -- otherwise the temperature might bounce right back up.","470":"Severe symptoms include increased fever, shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, fast breathing, bluish skin color, dizziness or confusion, or if you get better but then your symptoms return, even worse. Q. What fever-reducing medications can I take? Fever-reducing medications are medicines that contain acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Motrin). These medicines can be taken by people who are sick with flu to help bring down their fever and relieve their pain. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) should not be given to anyone younger than 18 years of age who have flu; this can cause a rare but serious illness called Reye\u2019s syndrome. Q. What steps can students, faculty, and staff take to stay healthy and keep from spreading the flu? Practice good hand hygiene. Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after coughing or sneezing. Alcohol-based (62% alcohol) cleaners are also effective.","471":"Back to Top What are the treatment options? Once you have determined that your child does have fever, you may treat it in a manner that you have previously discussed with the child's physician. DO NOT GIVE ASPIRIN to a child who has fever without first contacting the child's physician. Aspirin, when given as treatment for viral fevers in children, has been associated with Reye's syndrome, a potentially serious or deadly disorder in children. Therefore, pediatricians and other healthcare providers recommend that aspirin not be used to treat any fever in children. To safely reduce fever in children, use acetaminophen or ibuprofen products. And, be sure to consult your child's physician for any fever that spikes rapidly or resists treatment. A tepid bath (water that is neither too cool or too warm to the touch) may reduce the fever, as well as comfort the child.","472":"Sometimes doctors advise you to use both types of medicine. Take acetaminophen every 4 - 6 hours. It works by turning down the brain's thermostat. Take ibuprofen every 6 - 8 hours. DO NOT use ibuprofen in children younger than 6 months old. Aspirin is very effective for treating fever in adults. DO NOT give aspirin to a child unless your child's doctor tells you to. Know how much you or your child weighs, and then always check the instructions on the package. In children under age 3 months, call your doctor first before giving medicines. Eating and drinking with a fever: Everyone, especially children, should drink plenty of fluids. Water, popsicles, soup, and gelatin are all good choices. Do not give too much fruit or apple juice and avoid sports drinks in younger children.","473":"It's also important to tell your doctor what other medications or supplements you might be taking, even if it's just ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others). Taking aspirin and ibuprofen together reduces the beneficial effects of the aspirin. Taking aspirin with other anticoagulants, such as warfarin (Coumadin), could greatly increase your chance of bleeding. What's the best dose of aspirin to take? There's no uniform dose of aspirin you should take to get the benefits of daily aspirin therapy. You and your doctor will discuss what dose is right for you. Very low doses of aspirin \u2014 75 milligrams (mg), which is less than a standard baby aspirin \u2014 can be effective. Your doctor may prescribe a daily dose anywhere from 81 mg \u2014 the amount in a baby aspirin \u2014 to 325 mg (regular strength).","474":"What can I do to decrease my child's fever? Specific treatment for a fever will be determined by your physician based on: Aspirin and the Risk of Reye Syndrome in Children Do not give aspirin to a child without first contacting the child's physician. Aspirin, when given as treatment for children, has been associated with Reye syndrome, a potentially serious or deadly disorder in children. Therefore, pediatricians and other healthcare providers recommend that aspirin (or any medication that contains aspirin) not be used to treat any viral illnesses in children. your child's age, overall health, and medical history extent of the condition your child's tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or therapies expectations for the course of the disease your opinion or preference Administer an anti-fever medication, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen.","475":"Take acetaminophen every 4-6 hours. It works by turning down the brain's thermostat. Take ibuprofen every 6-8 hours. Like aspirin, it helps fight inflammation at the source of the fever. Sometimes doctors advise you to use both types of medicine. Ibuprofen is not approved for use under 6 months of age. Aspirin is very effective for treating fever in adults. DO NOT give aspirin to children. Fever medicines come in different concentrations, so always check the instructions on the package. Don't use any medicine to reduce fever in children under three months of age without first contacting a physician. If someone has heat exhaustion or heat stroke, remove the person from the heat source. Sponge the person with tepid water. Place ice packs in the armpits, behind the neck, and in the groin.","476":"Do NOT use cold baths or alcohol rubs. These cool the skin, but often make the situation worse by causing shivering, which raises the core body temperature. Drink cool liquids, as tolerated. Here are some guidelines for taking medicine: Acetaminophen and ibuprofen help reduce fever in children and adults. Take acetaminophen every 4 - 6 hours. It works by turning down the brain's thermostat. Take ibuprofen every 6 - 8 hours. Like aspirin, it helps fight inflammation at the source of the fever.

Pain Relievers\/Fever ReducersThis includes acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Motrin and Advil). Children under age 18 should not be given aspirin unless instructed by a doctor because of a potentially life threatening illness called Reye's syndrome. Acetaminophen is generally considered safe in infants and children over 2 months old but you should check with your child's doctor for dosing instructions and never give more than 5 doses in 24 hours. It is very easy to overdose on acetaminophen, which could cause serious harm. Ibuprofen is considered safe for children over 6 months old but you should check with child's doctor for dosing instructions. Ibuprofen can sometimes cause upset stomach so it should be avoided when a child may have stomach pain.","478":"High Temperature & Fever - SuperLiving Home Account About Us Information Contact Us Blog Family Health Your Health Body Health Complementary Therapies Happiness Success Resources Products List A-Z You Are Here: HomeYour Health High Temperature & Fever High Temperature & Fever High temperature or fever is a symptom that the body is fighting off an infection, and is easily checked with a medical thermometer.

Sign Up Discuss in my forum Ceramic vs Steel Kitchen Knives - Understanding the Differences The Difference Between a Ceramic Knife and a Steel Blade Kitchen Knife By Mariette Mifflin, About.com Guide See More About: cutlery cookware cutting boards chef's tools Ceramic and Steel Paring Knives Photo \u00a9 Mifflin There are basically two main types of kitchen knives, the traditional steel blade knife and the new kid on the block, the ceramic knife. If you're a little confused about the differences between these two knives, you're not alone. Ceramic knives tend to live a mysterious life so to speak and are very particular in what they can do, how they should be handled and how they should be stored.","480":"No, ceramic knives will never fully replace your traditional steel kitchen knives. That's mainly because they are limited when it comes to use. There's also less variety of styles and lengths of ceramic knives so you would still need steel knives for various cutting tasks. They are meant to be used for slicing only, but this may change in the future with industry advancements. As such, ceramic knives would nicely expand your selection of knives. That said, a ceramic knife might become your go-to knife for slicing tomatoes or vegetables, simply because of handling and performance preferences. Consumers should take care not to judge a ceramic by the same principles they do a steel knife. They are not cut from the same cloth and that would be like comparing apples to peaches. As for price, ceramic knives may seem more expensive, but a high quality steel knife can also set you back a few bucks.","481":"And remember that ceramic knives require less sharpening. When it comes to storing, ceramic knives require a protective sheath or proper storage container, something that is also recommended for sharp quality steel knives. The extra care needed for ceramic knives will probably deter some consumers, especially those who prefer carefree kitchen knives. The avid professional and home chef though, will find ceramic knives worth the care and they will probably have an assortment of ceramic to complement their cutlery essentials.

It all depends of course on the quality and design of the knife. Unlike a steel knife, a ceramic blade will not rust, pit or leave a metallic taste on foods. Blades will retain their sharp edge for a long time and must be sharpened either by the manufacturer or with a brand-specific specially designed ceramic knife sharpener. Because they are very sharp and brittle, ceramic knives must be stored in a custom sleeve or box. They should never be stored in a drawer with other (steel) knives. Though some manufacturers say their ceramic knives can be washed in a dishwasher, most recommend hand washing and I agree.

Why Ceramic Knives Are a Different Breed of Knife Ceramic knives on the other hand, are not as diverse as sizes and styles go and are generally limited to a few practical lengths. Quality ceramic knives are made of materials that are stronger than diamonds, usually zirconium oxide. Most ceramic blades are white, though there is a growing number of grey and black ceramic knives. The hardness of the ceramic gives these knives their long-lasting good looks, as well as a razor sharp edge that does not require sharpening for years. That is why many chefs love using ceramic knives. This sharpness makes slicing easier, allows precise cuts and extremely thin slices. The ceramic blade is stronger than steel but unfortunately, is more fragile because it is more brittle. That means that if you drop a ceramic knife or attempt to cut bone or frozen foods with one, it can break or chip.","486":"Now, a ceramic rod does work, but you have to understand that a fine ceramic is very fine -- almost not abrasive at all, and Japanese knife steel is normally harder than German knife steel, so you have to use it regularly (daily, or at least a few times a week), or else it simply won't do a darn thing. So if you have a Japanese or other knife with a similar polished edge (the Misono Japanese knives have polished edges), then a ceramic is a good choice. I personally think that some knives with a ground edge (most German knives) can keep that nice \"bite\" in their edge better with a traditional steel (metal), but the difference can be subtle. Mind you, I also use a steel on Global and other knives, and it works fine for me (with a gentle touch!).","487":"When buying knives, remember to factor in the cost of essential knife accessories such asstorage, a knife steel and one or two cutting boards. Proper knife storage is extremely important as it helps to protect the edge, as well as the knife point. When you do upgrade to a better quality knife, you'll immediately know it. As with18\/0 and 18\/10 flatware, or single-layer versus encapsulated cookware, you can feel the difference quality makes, see improved performance and enjoy your investment for years to come.

Mission knives uses titanium. Tygrys makes a knife with a steel edge sandwiched by titanium. Ceramics Numerous knives have been offered with ceramic blades. Usually, those blades are very very brittle, and cannot be sharpened by the user; however, they hold an edge well. Boker and Kyocera make knives from this type of ceramic. Kevin McClungcame out with a ceramic composite knife blade that much tougher than the previous ceramics, tough enough to actually be useful as a knife blade for most jobs. It is also user-sharpenable, and holds an edge incredibly well.

The material\u2019s properties make it particularly resistant to wear and tear, which means that a ceramic blade can hold its edge much longer than a steel blade without the need for re-sharpening as often as steel knives. Manufacturing Process Ceramic knives have a unique white ceramic blade that is made of zirconium oxide . The ceramic blade undergoes high-pressure molding before being fired (\u201csintered\u201d) \u2013 which takes several days of high temperatures (in excess of 1000C). The finished ceramic blade is then ground and polished on a diamond wheel to form a sharp cutting edge and attached to the knife handle. Shenzhen Ceramic Knife Benefits Holds edge much longer than steel. Ceramic\u2019s hardness means that the ceramic blade will resist wear and remain sharper.","491":"What else does Kyocera make?

What are ceramic knives made of? These knives are made of an advanced, high-tech ceramic called zirconium oxide (also called zirconia). Zirconium oxide is extremely hard, wear resistant, and chemically inert. For the technically minded, zirconium oxide has a hardness of 8.2 mohs (vs. steel at 5-6 mohs and diamond at 10 mohs).

Ideal for resharpening Japanese knives which are no longer responding to a fine hone, or for maintaining German or other European style knives. Works much like a regular butcher steel. This hone is equivalent to 300 grit, which is equivalent to about 800 grit in the Japanese system, so it's coarse, but not overly so. This length is great for just about any kitchen knife, including large chef's knives. Includes a quality black-finished wooden handle and steel hanger.","494":"But ceramic knives are gaining popularity with professional and home chefs. And there's a good reason for this. But I find there's very little information out there regarding ceramic knives or how they differ from traditional steel kitchen knives, so I aim to change that.

A hard knife, made out of steel or ceramic will chip. To compensate makers will sandwich or clad the hard steel, between soft steel. The edge can still chip, but the knife won't break, like a ceramic. Depending on the properties knife makers value, will effect their choice of steel and how they work with it. Shun values a sharp knife that will hold its edge a long time. Knives that have good wear resistance, in general are more difficult to sharpen. Additionally the cladding on a Shun is very soft and will easily scratch. The Edge Pro is a nice system, if you have a number of knives to sharpen. If you only have the Shun, then sending it out, makes more sense.","496":"5\" Pocket Knife - Kyotop Series - Ceramic Knives JavaScript seem to be disabled in your browser.

My property is surrounded by oak trees, and I've pushed the envelope by growing fruit trees right up to the canopy. In general, the apples that get Morning sun until noon seem to fruit prolifically, whereas the apples that get no Morning sun, but afternoon sun seem to fruit a lot less, much more biennially. What's interesting is that for example stone fruits like peaches are much less sensitive, fruiting like crazy in the same locations. As a whole, I've noticed much more open growth near the oak trees. The more the noon sun is blocked, the leggier and less productive the trees are. So noon time sun seems the most critical.","500":"SUNLIGHT It is best to place the bonsai so they get at least morning sun. Most evergreens, especially pines, need as many hours of direct sun as possible (in our climate.) Most other plants do well with morning sun through mid-afternoon. Some trees prefer light shade most of the day. These are thin leaf plants such as maples and plants that usually grow on the forest floor such as azaleas. Trees that get a lot of sun will actually produce more compact growth with shorter internodes and smaller foliage. If the plant is not getting enough sun, it will reach for it with longer internodes and gangly growth. It will also produce larger leaves to increase its sun exposure. Therefore, a balance should be reached so the plant gets enough sun for good bonsai proportions without burning the leaves.","501":"The very lean soil and substantial rock in the vineyard's upper horizon lessen fertility and keep fruit and berry clusters small, while sun exposure and microclimate provide ideal ripening conditions. This ripe, full bodied wine reflects the unique topography and microclimate of Walking Tree vineyard, with its morning sun influence and mid-valley elevation. Comprised of 12 pristine acres near the Geyser Peak Winery in the heart of Alexander Valley, Walking Tree's eastern facing rows bask in bright sunshine during the morning and are protected from direct sun during the hot afternoon. This balanced sun exposure promotes slow, steady ripening and ideal flavor development High elevation, with rocky soils drain quickly on this steep slope.

These do well in full sun much of the year and will need partial shade during the hot parts of the summer. This is why I mention the conditions under which you can grow these bonsai trees in a contolled atmosphere. A CHINESE PLUM IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE IN BONSAI TREES This species of bonsai produces pink and white flowers and purple fruit. This will certainly enchance your collection. It is true that most bonsai plants need some outdoors,this one can do well indoors with adequate sunshine. A hard commodity to come by in parts of the north and northeast.

Fruit: The fruit, borne singly or in pairs at the axils, is a berry with many minute seeds at the center. A gooseberry may be green, white (gray-green), yellow, or shades of red from pink to purple to almost black. Fruits of the European gooseberry may be very large, like a small plum, but are usually 1 inch long, less in width. American gooseberry fruits are smaller (to 1\/2 inch), perfectly round, all becoming pink to wine-red at maturity. Skin color is most intense in full sunlight. Berries generally drop when overripe. The fruit has a flavor all its own, the best dessert cultivars as luscious as the best apple, strawberry or grape. CULTURE Location: Gooseberries like morning sun, afternoon part-shade and buoyant air circulation.","505":"Shade in the afternoon will be better for your crops during the hot summer months, this is when the sun is it's most fierce. Severe temperature changes of shade in the morning and the hot blazing sun in the afternoon are difficult for most plants to handle. A gardens that faces east can benefit from the brightness of the sun in the morning and the shade in the afternoon. If your garden is in a location that is under deciduous trees, you can give your plants a head start by starting the seeds indoors or sow them directly into the garden early in the season before the trees form there leaves. The one thing about planting under trees is that the root system of the tree will compete with your garden plants for water and nutrients. Plants that are grown where there are trees will need extra care to make sure they receive the proper amount of water and nutrients to make up for there competition.","506":"The sun angle is getting higher and higher now, clearing the trees more and more so it may not have as much of an effect as I'm thinking. Anything past October 1st however gets dramatically less sun, like 4-5 hours worth a day, mostly late morning to mid afternoon. Its a very odd situation, different native climates between me and England, I get more sun, but im simulating their climate with some shade. Who knows what will happen, I remember 1 quote though: \"Remember, the biggest mistake about planting a fruit tree is not to do it!\" We'll see if \"Morning sun, afternoon shade\" is good enough. For fun, I've attached my climate data as well as Orleans France and Southampton England, places known to grow these varieties.","507":"H. plantaginea is one of the most heat tolerant Hosta species. Keep in mind, the heat experienced in a full sun location can vary from area to area and even during different times of the day. Full sun in the morning hours will not be as intense as full sun at noon. While yellow and fragrant hostas need some sun exposure, they do not like to bake or fry in the sun. So if your site is extremely hot or dry, you will need to keep any hostas sitting in full sun well watered. Hostas for Partial Shade: Green, Blue and White No Hosta is going to thrive in deep shade. They all need some sunlight to photosynthesize. The shade tolerant varieties seem to do best in an exposure of morning sun and afternoon shade Too much sun exposure will result in burned leaves, starting from the edges inward.","508":"Full morning sun or filtered sun with protection from the hot afternoon sun is best for most; however, the H. paniculata \u2018Pink Diamond\u2019 can grow in full sun. Direct afternoon sun on the big leaf hydrangea will give you a wilted plant every afternoon regardless of how much water they have. Hydrangeas are not drought tolerant plants, needing ample moisture to thrive. Fertilize with a slow release fertilizer in early spring after all frost has ended. A light application following the first flush of flowers can also be used. The season of pruning is not the same for all hydrangeas. Some plants bloom on the new growth\u2014Hydrangea paniculata and H. arborescens, so can be pruned before growth begins in early spring or as they are going dormant in the fall. I prefer to prune before new growth so there is at least some structure in the winter garden.","509":"Summer also has it's problems. Maples should not be placed in full sun all day, morning sun is best but the hot afternoon sun will put the tree and your ability to water it adequately, to the test. Acer Campestre the field maple. (Autumn) Watch out for The Red leafed cultivars of the Japanese maple (Acer Palmatum), are usually grafted onto normal (green leafed) rootstock, as they don't do well on their own roots. If you are buying a tree from a garden centre to convert into a bonsai, take a good look at the condition of the graft when purchasing the tree. In The UK we have two 'native' maples, the Field Maple Acer Campestre and the Sycamore Acer Psudoplatanus, the Field Maple makes a very good bonsai, having small leaves and good colour, the Sycamore does not!.","510":"Plant a fast growing plant hedge for privacy or beauty in your landscape.

It is a more reliable bloomer among the variegated varieties. Inner blooms can be pink or blue, surrounded by white. It is a lacecap mutation of Endless Summer, but will not rebloom. For best bloom production, plant in lightn shade, dappled shade, or morning sun with afternoon shade. Hardy in zones 5-9. \u2018Tokyo Delight\u2019 will produce pink blooms in alkaline soil, blue blooms in acid soil (pH of 6 or less) in July and August. Faded blooms begin to turn shades of burgundy in autumn. Blooms on old wood. Prefers part shade in moist, well drained soil. Grows to 3-6\u2019 high and wide. Hardy in zones 6-9, perhaps in zone 5. \u2018Mariesii Variegated\u2019 has cream edged foliage and is long blooming in early to midsummer. The cream variegation is not stable, and will sometimes revert to all green. Bluish white florets surround bright blue florets. Grows best in part shade in zones 8 and 9, full sun more north. Reaches 5\u2019 high and wide, growing in a dome shape. Pruning should be done right after the blooms fade, as it sets new blooms immediately after flowering. Blooms best in zones 8 and 9, bloom buds may freeze off in colder zones. Hardy in zones 5-9. Hydrangea quercifolia, \u201cOakleaf\u201d, are white blooming and are winter hardy further north than thearborescens.","513":"They then become poisonous. So as the leaves start to develop, we need to at least part cover them with earth. It seems counter-intuitive to bury a growing plant, but it it necessary. If you are growing potatoes in containers, this is easy to do. If you are growing them in the ground, it's easier to do it, if you have grown them in rows.

My apple trees are laden with little apples. Although this appears like a good thing, actually they need thinning out. June is the month when apple trees often shed excess fruit. This enables the tree to concentrate its resources on the remaining fruit, producing bigger apples.","514":"Taste is very good. Suggest training on wire,trellis or fence. Likes morning sun and afternoon shade. Plant 6 to 8 feet apart. ROLLINIA (Rollinia deliciosa) Click image to see full size photo A relative of the cherimoya, this fruit is much bigger and has the added advantage that it is self pollinating.

So when the temperature abruptly dipped by Monday night and into Tuesday morning, farmers were in their fields and orchards before Miguel Cintora, a worker at The Peters Orchards outside of York Springs, walks up rows of blooming peach trees on Monday afternoon.

Another important, but often missed consideration, is the shrub's size at maturity. Checking mature height and width will tell you the amount of space the shrub will need for optimum growth. Location Since our focus is on ornamental shrubs for sun, it is important to look at how light conditions are classified. Most shrubs adapt well to either sun or shade; however, some may produce fewer flowers in a shady location. Full sun - plants require at least 6 hours of direct, late-morning\/afternoon sun Partial shade - plants need a minimum of 4 hours of morning or afternoon sun, but should be shaded from the hot, midday sun.","518":"Looks best with some leaves trimmed away from lower parts of canes to expose to sun and show off colors.

Skargren et al [42,43] reported no differences between chiropractic and physical therapy patients at 6 months or 1 year in terms of pain, function, cost, or sick leave, although chiropractic was slightly more favorable for patients with episodes of less than a week and physical therapy more favorable for patients with episodes of more than a month. Cherkin et a [l9] reported no differences between chiropractic and McKenzie physical therapy groups during 2 years of follow-up in terms of pain and disability, and these groups had only slightly better outcomes and much greater costs than did patients in the control group receiving only an educational booklet.","521":"This is all part of the \"self-care\" or \"self-treatment\" aspect of physical therapy: through physical therapy, you learn good habits and principles that enable you to take better care of your body. Your physical therapist may also suggest a personalized exercise program for you. This can help reduce the likelihood of your back pain recurring and can also improve your overall health.

Medical and chiropractic care without physical therapy or physical modalities yielded similar improvements in pain severity and disability after 6 months of follow-up. Physical therapy appears to be more effective than medical care alone for reducing disability in some patients after 6 months, but the magnitude of this possible benefit is not large. Overall, there are only small differences in low back pain outcomes between the treatment groups in this population of largely subacute and chronic pain patients. Our study is one of many in recent years to compare various treatment approaches for patients with low back pain.","523":"RESULTS: Of 1,469 eligible patients, 681 were enrolled; 95.7% were followed through 6 months. The mean changes in low back pain intensity and disability of participants in the medical and chiropractic care-only groups were similar at each follow-up assessment (adjusted mean differences at 6 months for most severe pain, 0.27, 95% confidence interval, -0.32-0.86; average pain, 0.22, -0.25-0.69; and disability, 0.75, -0.29-1.79). Physical therapy yielded somewhat better 6-month disability outcomes than did medical care alone (1.26, 0.20-2.32). CONCLUSIONS: After 6 months of follow-up, chiropractic care and medical care for low back pain were comparable in their effectiveness. Physical therapy may be marginally more effective than medical care alone for reducing disability in some patients, but the possible benefit is small.","524":"My sincere thanks to the knowledgeable and well-trained staff at Ando & Aston Physical Wellness Therapy. F.W. Dear Fellow Pain Sufferers, I am happy to share my experiences at Ando and Aston Physical Wellness Therapy in hopes that other pain sufferers will find the incredible relief that I have. I have suffered with back, neck, shoulder, and hip and pelvic pain for 25 years. I have Fibromyalgia, Arthritis, Carpel Tunnel Syndrome, herniated discs, spinal stenosis, and more. Over the years I have taken many measures to improve my condition including surgery, chiropractic care, massage therapy, physical therapy, yoga, exercise, and pain medications. These brought me some relief but I still lived in constant pain. Besides not finding any real solutions, I often felt misunderstood, invalidated, and even dismissed by doctors who treated me simply because they could not help me.","525":"Turning to physical therapists for pain relief is effective because it gets to the root of the problem: \u201cBy determining the cause of a patient\u2019s low back pain, physical therapists get to the source of the problem and develop a treatment plan, which may include a combination of exercises to strengthen the back, manual therapy to improve the mobility of joints and soft tissues, and education about how to take better care of the back to relieve pain in the long term.\u201d Dr. Kim believes that physical therapy is a wonderful solution because of its ability to achieve long-term results. By addressing the cause of the pain, and not just the pain itself, physical therapists are able to create treatment plans that result in lasting pain relief. \u201cMy goal is to alleviate the pain of each and every patient,\u201d commented Dr. Kim.","526":"Start A Journal What Is Your Activity Level? 2 Back Pain Upper Lower What Is Sciatica?

Passive therapies, such as those listed above, are generally done in conjunction with active therapies. In the active part of physical therapy, your therapist will teach you various exercises to improve your flexibility, strength, core stability, and range of motion (how easily your joints move). Remember: Your physical therapy program is individualized, taking into consideration your health and history. Your exercises may not be suitable for another person with chronic pain, especially since chronic pain is such a subjective, personal experience. Other Aspects of Physical Therapy If needed, you will learn how to correct your posture and incorporate ergonomic principles into your daily activities.

C Asthma Chest physical therapy and physiotherapy breathing retraining have been studied in both children and adults to improve quality of life and improve lung function in severe and acute asthma. Early evidence is mixed. Studies often include combination treatment with drug therapy or are not well-designed, which make it difficult to assess the magnitude of benefit, if any, of physical therapy alone. More research is warranted. C Back pain Despite the large amount of research conducted on physical therapy cost-effectiveness and treatments for back pain (including chronic and acute low back pain, lumbar disc herniation, pregnancy-related back pain, work-related back pain), there is a lack of conclusive evidence that physical therapy is more effective than other treatments or placebo.","531":"More frequently, IMT is needed in the beginning in order to break the pain cycle. Once that is achieved, other treatment options are introduced. Once I am feeling better, how often do I need to come back to maintain my progress? The musculoskeletal system is under constant pressure from gravity, stress, work etc. A regular exercise program combined with good posture can prevent many problems. If the pain comes back, \"tune-ups\" are recommended to treat and prevent serious injuries. [Printable Version] Copyright 2012 SportsCare Physical Therapy. All Rights Reserved. Powered by e-Rehab.

Conclusions For patients with low back pain, the McKenzie method of physical therapy and chiropractic manipulation had similar effects and costs, and patients receiving these treatments had only marginally better outcomes than those receiving the minimal intervention of an educational booklet.

PHIL: The short answer to the first question is no. The show isn\u2019t what it once was. That being said, it\u2019s still one of the better shows on television. And you never know. It could be again at some point with the right writers. After all, the movie was pretty good. \u201cSouth Park\u201d has certainly surpassed \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d at this point, by a fairly wide margin. However, \u201cSouth Park\u201d might just be the best show on television now, so that\u2019s not much of a slight. \u201cKing of the Hill\u201d is always underrated, but if I had to pick a new episode to watch, I\u2019ll still take \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d The worst thing right now, for me, is seeing a younger generation flock toward the detestable \u201cFamily Guy,\u201d which could never hold a candle to any season of \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d There are kids out there who actually think \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d isn\u2019t funny, while \u201cFamily Guy\u201d is the most hilarious thing they\u2019ve ever seen.","561":"Family Guy - Oh Internet Home Log in \/ create account Main page Bulletin Board Current events Recent changes Random page Help Create with form Page Discussion View form History oh internet The OhInternet Forums are now open to everyone!

It is more difficult to actually learn how to snowboard, but easier to become proficient at it. In skiing, it is easier to learn, but more difficult to become proficient. She also says there is no difference in the danger level. \"The injuries are just different,\" Wetmore said. \"Ski injuries are usually to your thumb and lower body -- knee injuries and things like that. Boarding injuries are upper body -- such as broken wrists, dislocated shoulders. If I had the choice of blowing out my knee or dislocating my shoulder, I'd take the shoulder.\" While Wetmore feels it is difficult to teach the art of snowboarding without giving a visual demonstration, she did her best to explain the basic nuances of getting started.","580":"Bunny Hill is the beginners area and is serviced by a tow rope.

This trail is 1.5 miles long and covers 10.6 acres of land. If you are looking for something a bit more difficult, check out Go Down Under. This is the most popular trail to be found on the East Ridge and includes going through a tunnel. The Wisp snowboarding facility also has a Super Pipe, which was removed for a short period of time but has returned in a new location. Out of Bounds \u2013 If you feel like taking on more than just snowboarding, tubing is also available at the Wisp snowboarding resort.

Bear Peak has several glade areas that are usually opened only after a good season of natural snow. In case the weather isn't cooperating, the resort claims to have 97% coverage of snowmaking.

The binding is now ready for re-entry. Do not change the binding settings. If you feel that they are not working properly, bring them back to the shop for assistance. Avoid walking, skiing or snowboarding through water or mud. Water, mud and dirt can affect your bindings making release more difficult. While you are skiing or snowboarding, keep your boots properly closed. This allows the boot to support you properly and helps to keep your feet dry. If you have any questions, please ask for assistance.","587":"Wear the right gear. During warm spring temperatures, any skier will overheat in a heavy winter parka. Make sure you have a lighter jacket (or even a fleece!) for sunny days. A light, waterproof jacket is perfect for days where there may be rain. Get your skis tuned-up for spring.

The guides will show you the best of the steeps on both mountains, and give you the technical expertise, and steeps tactics to breeze through even the gnarliest terrain.","589":"Powder is known as being the most fun and challenging condition for skiing and snowboarding, solely because it is so soft. If powder snow sits undisturbed for too long it may become compacted and hard, sometimes icy. This is considered more difficult terrain to negotiate. Generally colder climates sport the lightest, driest powder, or \"cold smoke\", and countries like Switzerland are becoming known as powder havens. In places where almost all of the runs are groomed, and powder is a rare find, you must venture into the tree trails. Powder makes for much smoother turns and smoother riding. Powder also makes for softer landings and reduced chances of injury compared to man made terrain parks, though landing in deep snow can take some practice. Powder is best to ride when it is fresh, before other riders \"track it out\" and make ruts in the smooth surface.","590":"Helmets are not required but highly recommended. Beginning riders should rent their equipment when starting out. Once you are certain it will become a fulltime hobby and want to purchase equipment, a quality full package can run from $450 to $500. A word of warning -- do not buy equipment for teens who will outgrow their boots in six months. Wait until the growth spurt stops. According to Wetmore, no one should be intimidated about trying to start snowboarding, no matter what the age. Don't think that knowing how to ski will help; snowboarding is actually easier to learn by going in fresh. \"It's no more difficult to learn than skiing,\" says the 28-year-old Wetmore, who began riding six years ago. \"The movements are much different. With the exception of learning to ride the lift, you can throw all you know about skiing out the window when you learn to snowboard.","591":"There are, of course, differences in the equipment for each sport too. The one area where snowboarding can take a point away from skiing is the design of the boots. Snowboarders have the luxury of soft boots, something that after a full day on the slopes has a lot going for it. The external hard shell of ski boots makes them much more difficult to walk in. This may be the determining factor on whether to head straight to the bar and the gluwein after your last run or whether to head back to the chalet for a quick change of footwear!

If anything, it was a bit of a badge of honor; being good at basketball was what theKentucky Wildcats, the Vanderbilt Commodores, and the ACC had to ease the pain of not being good at football. That changed when the Arkansas Razorbacks, a football powerhouse in the Southwest Conference, joined the league and promptly won an NCAA championship in basketball. Shortly thereafter, theFlorida Gators hired Billy Donovan, and, all of a sudden, being serious about football and being serious about basketball ceased to be mutually exclusive, becoming instead a sign of seriousness about having an all-around first-class athletics department. It was one thing to be indifferent to basketball when we could snicker behind our hands at Georgia Tech, Kentucky, and Vanderbilt; now that Alabama, Florida, and Tennessee are serious about basketball, too, we have to be serious about basketball, as well.","609":"Plyometrics better than Conventional Strength Training?

Stripped down, just-the-facts site that shows why Michael Jordan is not the greatest basketball player ever. This is a bare-bones, all-facts\/no humor site. My Exposers of jordon's Foolishness Site was a lot of fun, but some people thought that because of the humor, that it completely lacked in factual information (due to the obviously absurd parts). As a result, I created this alternate, smaller site to prove what I said before: Jordan is good, but you cannot say with certainty that he is without a doubt, the greatest ever. You don't hear any baseball or football player called the best ever. Why basketball? Because basketball has degenerated from a serious sport into an entertainment business, and Jordan, while he was a great player, was an even better entertainer. Greatest entertainer? Ok. Greatest basketball player? No. The two should not be combined. I don't care if you think Michael Jordan is the 2nd greatest player of all-time. I don't care if you think that Wilt Chamberlain isnot the greatest player ever. I don't care if think he is better than Chamberlain and somebody else is better than both of them. This site has only one purpose: to show that no matter what criteria is used, Michael Jordan is not the greatest player ever. He maybe #2, #20, or #2000, but he is not #1. If you think he is in your opinion, that is fine, but I simply ask that you first define your criteria for judging players, and then I will show that your very own criteria does not support the conclusion that Jordan is #1.

No one really knows how strong the man of steel is and perhaps neither does he! Many wrongly think that just because Hulk is bigger and looks stronger than it means he is stronger. Superman can move planets...need I say more! Others believe Hulk would win because they're likely Marvel fan boys. Superman has defeated powerful opponents like Darkseid,Mongrel,Parasite,Doomsday,and General Zod;several of whom could likely take Hulk! Superman has more varied powers and because he's smarter can be more resourceful in using them. Speaking of intelligence,how the hell can anyone think that Superman isn't smarter than a human,even one as brilliant as Dr.Bruce Banner. Superman\/Kal-El is not only the son of Jor-El,Krypton's most brilliant scientist,but he's outsmarted Lex Luthor(one of the smartest people on earth)and Brainiac(the smartest artificial being ever created)so yes I think he's smarter than Banner.","620":"he he KillerTomato 9\/17\/2009 5:23:36 AM This fight has bothered me since Marvel vs DC back in the day.

Hulk\u2019s Strengths (or Why Hulk Could Knock Supes for a Loop) The Incredible Hulk definitely lives up to his name. His level of strength, endurance and healing ability is determined by his emotional state. Or to put it more simply, the madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets.

The Tale of the Tape Superman\u2019s Strengths (or Why Kal-El could KO Hulk) Well, Superman sort of has a reputation for being the most powerful being on the planet earth. Not only that, he\u2019s smart\u2013not smarter than Dr. Bruce Banner, but definitely smarter than the Hulk. If Superman is going to win this battle, he\u2019s going to have to rely on brains over brawn, which shouldn\u2019t be too hard, considering the Hulk\u2019s intelligence level is on par with the average 5-year old.","627":"The Incredible Hulk has fought a number of heavy-hitting bruisers as well\u2026 Abomination\u2013sort of the Bizarro-Hulk, Abomination has gamma-powered muscles and a scientists\u2019 brain. He\u2019s one of the few folks who has actually managed to KO the Hulk! Absorbing Man\u2013Crusher Creel possesses the ability to take on the characteristics of whatever he touches: steel, rock, etc. He\u2019s turned into stone and been smashed to pieces by the Hulk more times than we can count. The Leader\u2013gamma radiation gave this guy a big ol\u2019 brain instead of muscles. Despite his impressive intellect, he\u2019s never been able to get the Hulk down for the count, proving that sometimes might does make right! The Outcome So who wins? The way we see it, it goes down like this\u2026 After doing a number on Metropolis and laying waste to the Science Police and a few minor heroes, the Hulk finally comes face-to-face with the toughest battle of his life: Superman. The two lock horns and create massive amounts of property damage. No matter how hard Hulk hits Supes, the Big Blue Boy Scout just won\u2019t stay down, a fact that only serves to further enrage the Hulk. The adrenaline starts flowing and the Hulk \u201cHulks out,\u201d to use a popular phrase. Hulk could care less about the puny humans who get in his way but Superman is determined to make sure there will be no collateral damage in this fight. This distraction allows the Hulk to get in a few cheap shots, weakening the Man of Steel. Just as it\u2019s looking like we\u2019re going to see another Doomsday scenario, Kal-El whisks the Hulk off to the Arctic Circle where the only ones in danger are a few penguins and a polar bear.","628":"Bad guys evil plan, no matter how good, how brilliant, how ingenious, will be thwarted, usually by a guy in a costume, punching him or by an act of physical superiority. The message of the films, all problems can be solved via violence and being stronger. Brawn beats brain.\" You obviously haven't been watching closely enough - almost all superhero films involve the hero fighting a physically stronger enemy. Ironmonger, Abomination, Sabretooth are all bigger and physically stronger than Ironman, Hulk and Wolverine. The villain often uses their brains to become stronger than the hero, or handicap the hero (eg Kryptonite Island in the Superman reboot). The heroes always beat them by using their brains or cunning. Likewise Spiderman is usually weaker than whatever villain he is fighting, but usually wins through science.","629":"March 23rd, 2012 at 1:12 am Daron Woodward says: It\u2019s a great shame that there has been no small amount of deliberate \u2018spoiling\u2019 going on.

His book often teeters on the edge of cancelation; doesn't that suggest it's time to do something different? Change is usually good for a book. Superman proposed to Lois; Robin, the Titans, and the Legion grew up; Supergirl, Flash, Karate Kid, and Jericho died. We're all still here. Sometimes characters need to get stronger and nastier (Guy Gardner, Hawkman, Doc Magnus, Storm, Hulk, Invisible Woman). Sometimes they need to get weaker and more vulnerable (Superman, Batman\/Bruce Wayne, Flash\/Wally West, Wolverine). Change has worked for years at Marvel (look at almost any book). DC is finally catching up. The Guardians have claimed in the past that they know the future of the universe, that everything is part of their master plan.","631":"When Bruce experiences extreme stress, he becomes the Hulk, a green walking tank of a beast that will smash through anyone and anything until it's anger is satiated. It's a raw and aggressive series, where the madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets. Symbolic of runaway emotion, his indiscriminate rampages are a perfect example of the anti-hero concept that Marvel offers.

Doomsday- If he can beat the s**t out of Superman,Doomsday can beat Hulk without fear due to his immortality(?).","639":"To be successful at maintaining plant health and vigor, we must choose the correct type and size container and fill with an equally well selected soil mix. Container Type There are many types of pots or containers available today ranging from ceramic to plastic. While the ceramic and clay pots are generally more decorative than black plastic nursery cans, they may not be the most ideal. I use the rigid variety of black plastic nursery containers for all of my plumeria. These containers have at least 4 good drainage holes towards the bottom to allow for great drainage. They come in many sizes; 1 gallon, 2 gal., 3 gal. , 5 gal. etc... Also, they are cheap!! Salt buildup is not a problem as with standard clay pots. The black plastic nursery containers are much less likely to develop a drainage problem than pots with only one drainage hole in the bottom center.","640":"Clay pots require a high frequency of watering, so they're great for plants that like dry conditions. Clay is very porous, and salts - and sometimes algae - may build up on the exterior and rim of the pot. These containers also are heavy and breakable. Plastic containers are easy to use and easy to keep clean, and they retain moisture better than clay pots. New styles look like terra cotta or glazed ceramic; and although an advantage is that they're lightweight, this means they can turn over easily. Plastic is generally not breakable, however. Ceramic, glazed pottery retains moisture longer than unglazed pots, so make sure there is a drainage hole. Some foreign imports may be contaminated with lead, either in the clay or in the glaze. Metal is not recommended as a primary container for growing plants, as the metals can leach into the soil and cause toxicity problems.","641":"Liners have a limited life but by the time they have broken down repotting is usually necessary anyway. Plastic containers with their own saucers can be purchased in a wide range of styles and colours. Some have self-watering systems, A variety of ceramic pots are available but these can prove very heavy and care must be taken in securing them to upright supports. Hooks and pulleys can be used to make baskets more accessible. Potting Mixes Some special mixes are available for baskets. These generally include water-retention crystals and some mixes contain a lot of plastic foam to reduce the weight. Vermiculite or perlite also decrease the weight and are better soil conditioners. Give the container a good soaking after planting and allow it to drain before hanging. Plant Care Baskets require frequent water checks so that they don't dry out.","642":"Some other things to remember: Containers with narrow openings limit what you can plant. Plastic pots deteriorate when exposed to sunlight. Wooden containers that are not lined rot. (Redwood and cedar do better than other woods.) Terracotta pots dray out rapidly, so the plants require watering more often. In hot climates, pick light-colored pots to decrease the absorption of heat. Glazed ceramic pots work well from a watering standpoint and are attractive. Selecting Your Soil You want a planting medium that holds enough moisture to keep the roots of your plants from drying out, but one that also drains fairly rapidly. (Standing water in a container makes the plants themselves rot.) Every plant has individual soil requirements, although most will do well in a high-grade potting mixture. (Just as a word of caution, most commercial mixes run a little on the acidic side and may require the addition of lime.)","643":"If you allow for some growth, you increase the odds of your plant growing to full maturity. Materials Plastic pots are the least expensive container option, so they\u2019re great for anyone on a budget. It\u2019s true that they are usually the least attractive option, but they hold their moisture longer than clay or ceramic pots and are lighter and easier to move around. Clay pots are porous, so air moves easily through their walls. This is helpful in that it allows roots to breathe and keeps them out of direct water, but it\u2019s not helpful in that the soil tends to dry out quickly. In hot weather you\u2019ll need to closely monitor the moisture in your clay pots. They are a fairly inexpensive option for the home gardener after plastic, and they come in myriad shapes and sizes.","644":"Single-leader plants(plant has one stem - does not branch) such as dieffenbachia, rubber tree, and dracena, shouldn\u2019t be pinched (but can be air-layored). Pruning. Often a major branch must be removed, either to keep the plant the size you want or to improve its shape. Study the plant carefully before cutting off all or part of a major branch. Use clippers to get a smooth cut, and make the cut just above a growth bud. The best times to prune a plant are when it is in active growth (usually in the spring) or soon after it has bloomed. Some plants such as true Palms have only one growth point and trimming the top will kill the plant. Containers Which is better a clay pot, a plastic pot, a ceramic pot, an undrained container, or a pot with drainage holes and a saucer? Many indoor gardens attribute the success of failure of their plants to the type of container used for growing! Instead, look to the type of potting mixture being used and your watering habits. 90% of plants having problems are due to the nature of the growing medium. Most commercial potting soils are too dense, tend to compact and inhibit new root growth. Instead of being concerned that a pot \u201cbreathes\u201d look for a loose porous potting mix that allows roots oxygen. (See above for more info) Plants grown in clay will need watering much more frequently. In winter you must be careful for clay pots conduct the cold and can chill the roots. Clay pots will also need regular cleaning to keep free of algae and salt residue. Much more maintenance will be necessary in clay pots.","645":"For information regarding specific ingredients or allergic concerns, please call our Consumer Affairs department at 1-800-272-9652 weekdays between 9 AM and 4 PM Eastern Standard Time. Mirrors, Picture Frames, and Plant Pots\u2014Close adult supervision is required when children use craft materials that could shatter or break. Handheld mirrors, picture frames with glass, ceramic pots, and similar breakable items may be used only by children 8 years and older. For children 7 years and younger, use unbreakable materials such as wood or sturdy plastic picture frames, unbreakable mirrors, and plant pots that will not shatter into sharp edges. For a public display, the class can plant a garden on school grounds! Have students make a label for their plants that symbolizes their commitment to the community. Place labels in the soil near each student\u2019s seed.","646":"Then they carefully nurse the new roses along, providing the proper amounts of water and nutrients, until planting time arrives. This approach involves more work but offers the best chance of developing healthy roots and top growth. What Type of Container is Best? Most kinds of containers (which can include pots, tubs, troughs, hanging baskets, etc.) work well for roses, though most experienced gardeners have their favorites. The important requirements are that the container must be big enough to allow for proper root development and it must provide good drainage. It should also have a wide enough base to resist being blown over in a strong wind! Pots made of terra cotta, glazed ceramic, plastic, wood or even (for short-term use) biodegradable fiber are the containers most often used, with the ubiquitous black plastic nursery pots leading the way.","647":"Plastic pots and ceramic pots will hold more moisture freeing you from watering. They are especially good for plants that like to stay moist \u2013 eg ferns, ivies, and babies tears. They also do not need such frequent cleaning as clay. Ceramic pots often are not glazed on the bottom and can leave moisture-marks on furniture and carpets. The only problem with an undrained pot is that excess water is not removed automatically. Even with good drainage material like perlite at the bottom, excess water should be removed after watering by holding the plant at an angle with a hand over the soil so none falls out. Remember, any pot can grow a gorgeous plant, the secret is the soil \u2013 and your care holds the key to success! Moving Plants Cold weather (<50\u00b0F) Tropical plants brighten the indoors and add to our homes. However, one should be aware that these plants do not like the cold and will suffer damage from even brief exposure to air near freezing. When transporting them in winter (or any day when the temperature is below 50\u00b0!), it is important that plants be carefully wrapped. Wrap small plants in newspaper (roll pot to make a tube and fold over the excess paper at the top). Place larger plants (or several newspapered small plants) in a large plastic garbage bag. Blow into the bag to create a bubble of warm air and seal the bag tightly. Warm your car up and move your plants directly from the heated house to the heated car. Drive straight to your plant\u2019s new home. Plants cannot be left in an unheated vehicle.","648":"Pots can be terracotta, ceramic, plastic, or wood. Terracotta's earthy colour suits native plants but it is porous. For this reason, mixes such asDEBCO TERRACOTTA AND TUB MIX , orAMGROW SHRUB AND TUB, should be used. Cement pots should be used carefully because of their lime content. Plastic pots can be sued as liners for both cement, and terracotta pots. Growing Requirements Containers impose obvious restrictions on the root systems of plants. In the garden, roots are able to exploit a large volume of soil to obtain moisture and nutrients. In containers, there is a limited volume of soil providing nutrients and moisture, and drainage and aeration are reduced compared with the same soil in the garden. Prepared potting mixes available from yourGreengold Garden Centre, are the easiest and cheapest source of potting soil. Beware of cheap potting mixes - it is a false economy to buy a good plant, and expect it to grow happily in cheap potting mix.","649":"Our own tropical paradise, right inside out own home. Many tropical plants will grow with the right care and conditions in areas that normally would not permit them. These same plants that grow in abundance in Asia, South America, Africa, can grow right in your own living room, ready to pluck the ripe, sweet fruit grown specifically by you. Potting There are many different types of pots available and each has its benefits and drawbacks. There is plastic with can heat up or freeze quickly, Metal, same as plastic. Clay and wood dry quicker, ceramic that can be heavy and many others that you can buy at local garden centers. For the most part all can be used quite successfully with tropical plants. Choose one based on your own preferences. These pots should have holes in the bottom for adequate drainage.","650":"You\u2019ll also want to be careful about the material your container is made of. Containers are either porous or nonporous. Plastic, glazed ceramic, and dark glass containers are nonporous and hold water better. Wood, unglazed ceramic (like terracotta), or papier mache pots are all porous and lose moisture more quickly. You can plant in either porous or nonporous containers, but you will need to adjust how much, and how frequently, you water your plants, and pay special attention to drainage. To aid in good drainage flow, make sure any container you use has several drain holes along the bottom edge. After you\u2019ve chosen containers appropriate to the vegetables you plan to grow, and placed your containers in the warmest sunniest spot you can find, you will need to choose a suitable growing medium. A good growing medium will hold water and provide adequate nutrients and physical support to grow healthy plants.","651":"The first pot should be at least 9 inches in diameter. Terra cotta, plastic or ceramic pots will work. Every two or three years, depending on how fast your tree grows, you will need to transplant it into the next sized pot. Starting out with a very large pot will not work as well as graduating your plant to increasing larger pots as they grow. Unless you buy a tree already potted, you will need to buy a top-grade commercial potting soil that has very good drainage. Excellent drainage is essential for successfully getting your tree to bear fruit. Like many of your other house plants, dwarf citrus benefit from being moved outdoors in summer. When outdoor night temperatures are consistently in the mid-50s or higher, it's time to move them outdoors. Accustom your tree to the outdoors gradually.","652":"Old metal watering cans are popular, as are redundant bicycles and their baskets. Metal or plastic buckets can also be used to plant in, as long as they have drainage. You could also think about using ceramic materials. Old Belfast-style sinks and even porcelain toilets and standalone baths have been sunk into the ground and used as pots and planters! Similarly, smaller items like teacups and ceramic bowls can also make interesting planters. Another great way to integrate recycled materials into your garden is to use spent large tins and pots. If you can get your hands on the wholesale size metal oil drums (available from food co-operatives, cash and carry stores or larger supermarkets, or ask around at restaurants and cafes), they can make fantastic pots and planters. Foreign packaging designs can be bright and fun, and the containers will not only look cheerful, but also rust and age in a very interesting way.","653":"The more sophisticated giftee may appreciate a colorful and delicate orchid. For those with asthma or allergies, plants like palms, peace lilies and ferns do an excellent job of improving air quality and filtering out toxins. Containers make a difference: Those boring, plastic pots that house most plants are not very attractive or personal. Pop your plants into colorful ceramic, glass, wood or even metal containers for a more interesting and personal touch. Inexpensive terra cotta pots can be painted in bright or metallic-colored paint, large coffee cups as containers can add a quirky element or baskets can be lined with plastic and used to hold small pots. When repotting plants yourself, make sure to use a high-quality potting mix such as Miracle-Gro Potting Mix or Miracle-Gro Organic Choice Potting Mix. Also, keep in mind that specialty plants like cacti, African violets and orchids may perform better in special potting mixes.","654":"3. Size of Your Container Plants are usually planted closer together in containers than they are in the ground. Be sure to leave enough room in the container for your rose to grow. It needs room for root growth and space for good air circulation. Many beginners to container planting make the mistake of planting their roses in containers that are really too small. They end up repotting quickly as the roses outgrow the original pot. 4. Type of Containers There are a lot of different containers to choose from for your roses. While most roses come in perfectly usable plastic pots, remember that black and other dark colored plastic containers will absorb heat and dry out the soil much more quickly than lighter colored pots. Ceramic and wooden pots are also good choices. You can find decorative terra cotta pots at many garden centers, but they lose water more quickly than some other types of pots.","655":"DAI HONG PHAT PRIVATE ENTERPRISEClick on Company Name above for more detailed information!

Deciding between the IELTS or TOEFL Exam - Important Differences By Kenneth Beare, About.com Guide See More About: taking exams toefl exam cambridge exams ielts exam exam study resources There is a wide choice of English tests available, but often English students are asked to choose between the IELTS or TOEFL exam. Often it is the students' choice as both exams are accepted as meeting the entry requirements for academic settings. However, in some cases the IELTS is requested for visa purposes to Canadian or Australian immigration. If this is not the case, you have even more to choose from and may want to review this guide to choosing an Engish test before you decide on the IELTS or TOEFL.","664":"Both tests are also different in how the test is administered. Here are considerations for each question when deciding between the IELTS or the TOEFL. Do you need the IELTS or the TOEFL for academic English? If you need the IELTS or TOEFL for academic English, then keep answering these questions. If you don't need the IELTS or TOEFL for academic English, for example for immigration, take the general version of the IELTS. It is much easier than either the IELTS academic version or the TOEFL! Are you more comfortable with North American or British \/ UK accents? If you have more experience with British English (or Australian English), take the IELTS as vocabulary and accents tend more towards British English. If you watch a lot of Hollywood movies and like US idiomatic language, choose the TOEFL as it reflects American English.","665":"TOEFL, IELTS, GRE & GMAT | Graduate School | UTSA - University of Texas at San Antonio The University of Texas at San Antonio myUTSA \u00bb ASAP \u00bb Blackboard \u00bb Staff Webmail \u00bb Libraries Info For \u00bb Students \u00bb Faculty \u00bb Staff \u00bb Parents \u00bb Visitors Maps \u00bb Main \u00bb Downtown \u00bb Hemisfair Park Directory Calendar About UTSA Graduate Admissions Future Students Current Students Faculty\/Staff Graduate Programs Funding International Students Military Contact Us About Us International Future Students Graduate Admissions Newly Admitted Students Current Students TOEFL, IELTS, GRE & GMAT TOEFL \/ IELTS TEST SCORES (INTERNATIONAL APPLICANTS): The TOEFL or IELTS is required for all international applicants.","666":"TOEFL, IELTS & Other English Language Tests | ASU Global Education Skip to content Skip to navigation Navigation: ASU Universal ASU Home My ASU Colleges & Schools A-Z Index Directory Map Sign In \/ Sign Out SIGN IN Search Search ASU Global Education Home \u203a AECP Home \u203aAbout AECP \u203a TOEFL, IELTS & Other English Language Tests TOEFL, IELTS & Other English Language Tests On This Page...

In the TOEFL, you will have 40 - 60 minutes worth of listening selections from lectures or campus conversations. Take notes and respond to multiple choice questions.

If you type very slowly, I would strongly recommend taking the IELTS as you handwrite your essay responses. Do you want to finish the test as quickly as possible? If you become extremely nervous during a test and want the experience to end as quickly as posable, the choice between IELTS or TOEFL is easier.

Some early studies of ALN at other universities indicate that ALN is more effective than traditional pedagogy. However, skepticism regarding labor intensity and need for high faculty dedication to ALN are well grounded. Networked courses are cheaper than traditional courses due to virtual elimination of needs for physical classrooms, building maintenance, and expensive on-site faculty. They can be virtually paperless and administered with little or no contact between faculty and students.

Enemies also give you a standard against which to judge yourself. It took Joe Frazier to make Muhammad Ali a truly great boxer. The samurai of Japan had no guage of their excellence unless they challenged the best swordsmen they could find. For the Indianapolis Colts of last year, each victory was hollow unless they could beat their arch-rivals, the New England Patriots. The bigger the opponent, the greater your reward, even in defeat, for if you lose, you have opportunities to analyze the results and discover how and why you lost, then correct your strategy for the next time. For there willalways be a next time. Don't seek to eschew enemies, either. Enemies give us options and purpose.

In the dystopian future Zittrain sees, an unprecedented shift of power from end users and software developers to operating system vendors means the Apples, Googles, and Microsofts of the world will control what you can do with your PCs, phones, and tablets - and we'll all be the worse for it. While Wildstrom acknowledges that Zittrain is a very smart and witty guy, he thinks the professor is missing something very important: user experience, which Wildstrom characterizes as \"horrible\" back in Zittrain's glory days of computing freedom, observing that the many millions of people who have bought iPhones and iPads have chosen to cede to Apple the right to to choose what software their devices can run in exchange for a superior user experience.","705":"Vuzix SMART glasses bring Augmented Reality into focus at CES Flip To Hand Over Sharing Platform Flipshare To Givit, Users Have 30

In second language acquisition theory this is known as the critical period hypothesis. Marcus points out that this theory\u2019s argument is getting weaker and weaker as more and more research is done. He does point out two factors that make it seem like kids do better.

Give a kid and instrument and they will patiently play it for hours with no real concern that they are unable to play a tune yet. This allows kids more repetition than adults who have little patience to stick with something in which an immediate sense of accomplishment is lacking. I often encourage language learners to listen, watch or read the same stories repeatedly. Many find this a difficult task. To learners driven by ideas of productivity and outcomes, watching the same movie twice can seem a maddening idea. Inhibition Kids don\u2019t care. They don\u2019t care if they sound bad.

London scored well on the quality and reputation of its universities, including Imperial College, University College London and King's College London. The two cities did similarly well on quality of life, student mix and how well employers rated their universities as a source of good recruits. But fees - calculated in this survey as \u00a320,000 a year for international students from outside the European Union - meant that London lost out against Paris, where they are just \u00a31,000 a year.

By Stacey Colino for Live Right Live Well Agave syrup, stevia, honey and other natural sweeteners are all the rage these days, as more people worry that white sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are making them gain weight and increasing their risk for type 2 diabetes. But are natural sweeteners really any better than plain baking sugar? A reality check: For the most part, your body can\u2019t tell the difference between one type of sweetener and another.","747":"One common area of uncertainty in following a diet for both IBS and diabetes is how to handle sugar and desserts. Most people with IBS do not have problems with plain refined sugars (like white or brown baking sugar), which means that IBS-safe dessert recipes simply depend on a low fat, dairy-free foundation. However, this is an area of much more serious concern for diabetics. Unfortunately, simply using artificial sweeteners as an alternative is likely to be problematic for IBS. Artificial sweeteners in general can cause all sorts of gastrointestinal side effects, from gas and diarrhea to severe cramping. This is particularly true for sorbitol, which is the artificial sweetener most commonly used in commercial diabetic candies and cookies. In general, be quite cautious withall artificial sweeteners, including saccharine, NutraSweet, and Splenda, as people with IBS seem to be more sensitive than most folks to food chemicals, additives, and preservatives.","748":"Tools E-mail Print 0 Comments Digg Del.icio.us Tweet By: Story Updated: Sep 26, 2011 Live Right Live Well: Diet Natural Sweeteners: Any Better Than White Sugar?

But are natural sweeteners really any better than plain baking sugar? A reality check: For the most part, your body can\u2019t tell the difference between one type of sweetener and another. And most sweeteners contain similar amounts of calories: approximately 16 per teaspoon. \u201cAdded sugar, no matter where it comes from, is added sugar -- and in excessive amounts, it could increase body fat,\u201d says registered dietitian Lona Sandon, an assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.","749":"You aren't alone. The popularity of artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes is on the rise as manufacturers and consumers seek lower calorie alternatives to regular white sugar without sacrificing sweetness. Today, artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes are found in a variety of food and beverages marketed as \"sugar-free\" or \"diet,\" including soft drinks, chewing gum, jellies, baked goods, candy, fruit juice and ice cream. In addition, other sugar substitutes are being touted as healthier sweeteners than regular sugar, even if they don't have fewer calories, such as honey and agave nectar. Just what are all these artificial sweeteners and sugar substitutes? And what's their role in your diet? Understanding artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes Sugar substitutes are loosely considered any sweetener that you use instead of regular table sugar (sucrose).","750":"Moderation Is Key For most people, eating natural sugar or using artificial sweeteners isn\u2019t going to cause big weight fluctuations or health problems. However, eating too much of any kind of sweetener \u2013 whether it is natural or manmade \u2013 is where trouble comes in. It is especially dangerous to consume excessive sugar if you\u2019re living with diabetes. Stay safe with your sweets by avoiding too much of any good thing. How\u2019s It Get White? If you\u2019ve ever seen sugar right off the cane, you know that sugar isn\u2019t naturally white. Instead, it is yellow or brown. So how do they come up with that pure, white color for the sugar you may use every day? Through a bleaching process. In other words, the white sugar you use in your tea is essentially an artificial sweetener.","751":"Sugar and other sweeteners Subscribe To This Site Sugar And Other Sweeteners True Danish flavoured schnapps should not contain more than 15 grams sugar per liter. But of course, you can add as much sugar or other sweeteners as you want to suit your own taste. Also, if your infusion is too weak-flavoured you can certainly enhance the flavours by adding a little, little bit of sugar. Sugar is a great flavour enhancer. You can add the sugar directly, but because sugar is more soluble in water than in alcohol, it's usually better to make a simplesugar syrup... ...and add it to your infusion little by little. Never use artificial sweeteners - NEVER! You will ruin the taste. White sugar does not impart a distinctive taste of its own. That's why it's commonly used as flavour enhancer.","752":"Updated: March 31, 2011 12:03 PM EDT \u00a9 Hemera \/ Thinkstock From Live Right Live Well More>> Vitamins that keep your brain young Eat this: Foods that help heartburn The surprising secret to happiness What\u2019s upsetting your stomach?

Obesity, often accompanied by diabetes and heart disease, is just one more consequence of our high-sugar diet. Your long-term goal should be to slowly decrease the sugar and simple carbohydrates (white flour, white rice, ect.) in your diet. Do not try to stop cold turkey as you may get withdrawal symptoms, just like stopping other drugs. Replace simple sugars with whole grains. You know a whole grain because it will contain a fair amount of fiber. The more fiber the better. Eat more fruit to satisfy your sweet tooth. Artificial sweeteners are just as bad and can have many side effects. Try Stevia instead.

Try increasing your nutritional mineral intake to help make a quicker transition from sugar cravings to good food cravings, and improve your energy levels. \u201cBodies are made of food,\u201d said Dr. Janet Goodrich in her book H elp Your Child to Perfect Eyesight without Glasses. Everyday remind yourself that food is both your fuel and what all the new cells in your body are made from. Food is also a comfort and a pleasure. I believe in a diet that is 85-95% healthy and body wise, and the other 5-15% for enjoyment of life in a body! Whether you live in the city or the country, food producers are finding better ways to process and distribute natural foods that give sweetness without the negative side effects of sugar. Alternatives such as stevia (an herb which is actually good for you, and many many times sweeter than sugar), maple syrup and fruit juice concentrates are more and more available, and being chosen by consumers as the facts about white sugar (and artificial sweeteners) continue to emerge into the mainstream.","758":"Naturally occurring sugars are found naturally in foods such as fruit (fructose) and milk (lactose). Added sugars include any sugars or caloric sweeteners that are added to foods or beverages during processing or preparation (such as putting sugar in your coffee or adding sugar to your cereal). Added sugars (or added sweeteners) can include natural sugars such as white sugar, brown sugar and honey as well as other caloric sweeteners that are chemically manufactured (such as high fructose corn syrup). You can use sugars to help enhance your diet. Adding a limited amount of sugar to improve the taste of foods (especially for children) that provide important nutrients, such as whole-grain cereal, low-fat milk or yogurt, is better than eating nutrient-poor, highly sweetened foods. Back to top Sources of added sugars The major sources of added sugars in American diets are regular soft drinks, sugars, candy, cakes, cookies, pies and fruit drinks (fruitades and fruit punch); dairy desserts and milk products (ice cream, sweetened yogurt and sweetened milk); and other grains (cinnamon toast and honey-nut waffles).","759":"Too bad it is often mixed with acesulfame K which has real serious question marks, and shouldn\u2019t be on market,\u201d said Jacobson.

Jacobson said seltzer water, milk, or just plain water are safer and healthier options for drinks. \u201cStill, I think drinking a diet soda is better than the ten to twenty teaspoons of sugar you're going to get in a real soda, plus all those calories,\u201d said Jacobson. \u201cProbably the best thing is to avoid them both.\u201d But don\u2019t dismiss the little white packet, encourages The Sugar Association.","760":"Vegetables and grains can be eaten most anytime. Enjoyment of food is a sign of health. When our body and soul are in balance, what we tastes good is good for us. [Fitness and nutrition help our bodies, attitude helps our soul \u2013 seenext issue.] Beverages. Vegetable juices are rich, alive, powerful and infinitely better than any supplement or vitamin in pill or powder form. Avoid additives \u2013 corn syrup, sugar, artificial sweeteners \u2013 as well as soft drinks, coffee, cocoa and alcohol. Breads.

Make them a part of any dish - bake, grill, boil or fry. Chicken breasts are quite adaptable and can be used in variety of dishes, ranging from easy, quick, healthy recipes to exotic ones. Chicken breast is the leanest part of the chicken and is therefore healthier. However, chicken with the skin doubles the fat content. Hence, chicken is best skinned before cooking. Lean chicken breast has the least amount of fat, cholesterol and saturated fatty acids. It is a good source of Vitamins A and E. \u00c2 Chicken breast should be cooked until it reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees.

That is quicksort! Simple and elegant! It is a pure divide and conquer approach like merge sort, but while merge sort\u2019s tricky part was merging the sorted sub-lists, in quicksort there are other things to consider. First of all, the best choice for a pivot is the bottleneck. Indeed it all depends on that pivot. Imagine that you choose the greatest value from the list \u2013 then you have to put all the other items of the list into the \u201cleft\u201d sub-list. If you do that on each step you\u2019ll practically go into the worst scenario and that is no good. The thing is that in the worst case quicksort is not so effective and it\u2019s practically as slow as bubble sort and insertion sort.","787":"If you bother to learn Heapsort well, you don't really *need* any other sorting algorithm.

With multi-core architectures like the PS3 it makes sense to parallelize this operation to maximize the use of these cores. In the first three parts we have implemented the quicksort, merge and merge sort algorithms, as well as optimized them on the PS3's PPU. In this part we will start running these implementations on a SPU to improve performance even further. Quick Links Part 1 (Quicksort) Part 2 (Merge) Part 3 (Merge Sort) Part 4 (Offloading on 1 SPU) Part 5 (Parallel Sort on 2 SPUs) Part 6 (Final Optimizations) The entire series is also available as a single PDF document. Offload The Sort Code On 1 SPU The first step for sorting in parallel is to offload sorting an array chunk on a SPU using Offload.","789":"The performance for sorting 20K floats and 20K ints on 2 SPUs is similar to 1 SPU, which is reasonable since this is the threshold for offloading instead of doing another level of recursion. However, we see ~3x speed-ups over PPU when sorting >20K arrays using merge sort (the speed-ups with quicksort are not as good). In addition, despite using the vectorized merge function presented earlier in the series, we do not see any significant difference in performance between sorting floats on integers on the SPU. In the next and last post in the series we will see how to improve our parallel sort so that it can run on 4 SPUs instead of 2. In addition, we will show how to parallelize merge to run on any number of SPUs which will improve performance even further.","790":"(Quicksort is one sort algorithm that is generally very fast and has good locality of reference.) If the file is too huge, however, even virtual memory might be unable to fit it. Also, the performance may not be too great due to the large amount of time it takes to access data on disk. Methods Most external sort routines are based on mergesort. They typically break a large data file into a number of shorter, sorted runs. These can be produced by repeatedly reading a section of the data file into RAM, sorting it with ordinary quicksort, and writing the sorted data to disk. After the sorted runs have been generated, a merge algorithm is used to combine sorted files into longer sorted files. The simplest scheme is to use a 2-way merge: merge 2 sorted files into one sorted file, then merge 2 more, and so on until there is just one large sorted file.","791":"However we may say what is the complexity of Shell sort with the sequences of Knuth, Pratt and Donald Shell. For the Shell\u2019s sequence the complexity is O(n2), while for the Pratt\u2019s sequence it is O(n*log2(n)). The best approach is the Knuth sequence where the complexity is O(n3\/2), as you can see on the diagram bellow. Complexity of Shell sort with different gap sequences. Application Well, as insertion sort and bubble sort, Shell sort is not very effective compared to quicksort or merge sort. The good thing is that it is quite easy to implement (not easier than insertion sort), but in general it should be avoided for large data sets. Perhaps the main advantage of Shell sort is that the list can be sorted for a gap greater than 1 and thus making less exchanges than insertion sort.","792":"If the system qsort() had been written with a qif statement to quasistatically select between a quicksort implementation or a merge sort implementation, it would not be necessary to go to this kind of effort, nor necessary to speculate about whether typical user files provided as input to eqntott tend to elicit O(N ) behavior from the quicksort used; whether or not quicksort often behaved poorly or not on user inputs would be directly observed and taken into account. Furthermore, casual trials with another similarly-sized input file for eqntott (modeling a 4-bit 16-input\/output multiplexer) suggests that the reference input file for the SPECint92 benchmark use of eqntott is in fact somewhat anomalous for eliciting such poor behavior from quicksort; however, program performance for the multiplexor input file was still about 20% better with merge sort than with quicksort, consistent with the results in Table which shows that the merge sort implementation tends to perform fewer comparisons --- and the number of comparisons, when each comparison can be quite expensive, will dominate the running time more than the efficiency of the inner loops of the sorting algorithm.","793":"Investigation readily uncovered that the Linux system qsort() is supplied by the GNU implementation of the libc library; by default, it does not use the quicksort algorithm, but rather uses the merge sort algorithm if it can allocate enough temporary buffer to perform a standard two-space merge sort, only falling back to an in-place quicksort if the attempt to allocate memory fails. Both merge sort and quicksort are on average O(N log N) algorithms; however, in the real world, constant factors and not just asymptotic algorithmic complexity matters. It is generally acknowledged that implementations of some of the quicksort variants have the lowest constant factors of well-known comparison-based sorting routines; this is borne out by some basic experimentation --- each row of Table was generated by summing the times and comparisons for 5 different runs, each run sorting 1,000,000 integers generated by random() with seed values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.","794":"The simple form takes aList and sorts it according to its elements' natural ordering. If you're unfamiliar with the concept of natural ordering, read theObject Ordering section. The sort operation uses a slightly optimized merge sort algorithmwhich is fast and stable: Fast: It is guaranteed to run in n log(n) time and runs substantially faster on nearly sorted lists. Empirical tests showed it to be as fast as a highly optimized quicksort. A quicksort is generally considered to be faster than a merge sort but isn't stable and doesn't guaranteen log(n) performance. Stable: It doesn't reorder equal elements. This is important if you sort the same list repeatedly on different attributes. If a user of a mail program sorts the inbox by mailing date and then sorts it by sender, the user naturally expects that the now-contiguous list of messages from a given sender will (still) be sorted by mailing date.","795":"Simple version In simple pseudocode, the algorithm might be expressed as this: function quicksort(array) var list less, greater if length(array) \u2264 1 return array \/\/ an array of zero or one elements is already sorted select and remove a pivot value pivot from array for each x in array if x \u2264 pivot then append x to less else append x to greater return concatenate(quicksort(less), pivot, quicksort(greater)) The quicksort on average requires O(n log n) comparisons and worse case O(n^2). Merge sort The merge sort implements a divide and conquer strategy. If the size of a sublist is 0 or 1 it\u2019s sorted. The merge sort breaks up a list into two sublists of equivalent size.

Merge Sort We can develop a number of sorting techniques based on the divide and conquer technique. One of the most straightforward is merge sort . In merge sort, you split the list, array, collection or ... into two parts, sort each part, and then merge them together.

Compare the worst-case running time of STOOGE-SORT with that of insertion sort, merge sort, heapsort, and quicksort. Do the professors deserve tenure? 8-4 Stack depth for quicksort The QUICKSORT algorithm of Section 8.1 contains two recursive calls to itself. After the call toPARTITION, the left subarray is recursively sorted and then the right subarray is recursively sorted. The second recursive call in QUICKSORT is not really necessary; it can be avoided by using an iterative control structure. This technique, called tail recursion, is provided automatically by good compilers. Consider the following version of quicksort, which simulates tail recursion.","802":"Of course the \"some operation\" is very different between partition and merge, and it occurs at a different time - but it's an interesting parallel nonetheless. One significant difference between merge sort and quicksort is the use of the pivot. Once Partition has returned where the pivot element ended up, quicksort doesn't touch that element itself (we already know it will be in the right place). It recurses on the sublist entirely to the left of the pivot and the sublist entirely to the right of the pivot. Compare this with merge sort with recurses on two sublists which together comprise the whole list for that call. The overloading of the word \"index\" here is unfortunate, but that is unfortunately life. Both sorts of \"index\" here really are indexes... you just need to keep an eye on which is which.","803":"On the plus side, merge sort is a stable sort, parallelizes better, and is more efficient at handling slow-to-access sequential media. Merge sort is often the best choice for sorting a linked list: in this situation it is relatively easy to implement a merge sort in such a way that it does not require \u03a9(n) auxiliary space (instead only \u03a9(1)), and the slow random-access performance of a linked list makes some other algorithms (such as quick sort) perform poorly, and others (such as heapsort) completely impossible. As of Perl 5.8, merge sort is its default sorting algorithm (it was quicksort in previous versions of Perl). In Java, the Arrays.sort() methods use mergesort and a tuned quicksort depending on the datatypes. [edit] Utility in Online Sorting Mergesort's merge operation is useful in online sorting, where the list to be sorted is received a piece at a time, instead of all at the beginning.","804":"The problem is that in the worst case it is O(n2) \u2013 same as bubble sort. Obviously the worst case is when we have an already sorted list, and we constantly take for a pivot the last element of the list. But we should consider that in practice we don\u2019t quite use sorted lists that we have to sort again, right? Application Quicksort is a great sorting algorithm and developers often go for it, but let\u2019s see some pros and cons of it. Why using quicksort Recursive implementation is easy In general its speed is same as merge sort \u2013 O(n*log(n)) Elegant solution with no tricky merging as merge sort Why not using quicksort As slow as bubble sort in the worst case! Iterative implementation isn\u2019t easy There are faster algorithms for some sets of data types Quicksort is beautiful because of the elegant idea behind its principles.","805":"In the worst case, merge sort does about 39% fewer comparisons than quicksort does in the average case; merge sort always makes fewer comparisons than quicksort, except in extremely rare cases, when they tie, where merge sort's worst case is found simultaneously with quicksort's best case. In terms of moves, merge sort's worst case complexity is O(n log n)\u2014the same complexity as quicksort's best case, and merge sort's best case takes about half as many iterations as the worst case. Recursive implementations of merge sort make 2n - 1 method calls in the worst case, compared to quicksort's n, thus has roughly twice as much recursive overhead as quicksort. However, iterative, non-recursive, implementations of merge sort, avoiding method call overhead, are not difficult to code. Merge sort's most common implementation does not sort in place, meaning memory the size of the input must be allocated for the sorted output to be stored in.","806":"Doctor Recommended According to Dr. Oz, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Doctor\u201d, host of the Dr. Oz Show and Vice-chair and Professor of Surgery at Columbia University: \u201cSardinians\u2026 (one Blue Zone population) drink goat milk which is high in calcium and good for your heart. Plus, researchers believe it could protect against Alzheimer\u2019s and heart disease.\u201d It has more easily digestible, short and middle chain fats and protein solids than cow milk and may be enjoyed by many people who are lactose intolerant. The increased digestibility of protein is important for infants and children. In addition, goat milk is higher in calcium and vitamin A than cow milk and the natural buffering qualities of goat milk make it beneficial for people with ulcers and other stomach problems. Casein in Goat Milk Casein is a natural protein that is found in all milk. Many people have difficulty with Casein especially the Alpha S1 casein found in cow milk and so are allergic to cow dairy. Studies have shown that goat milk is very low in Alpha S1 casein and primarily contains Alpha S2 casein. That is why those allergic to cow dairy can use goat milk products in their diets successfully.","807":"A dairy doe should be milked in the same manner as a dairy cow, using good dairy hygiene. Does may be milked by hand or machine. The milk requires the same careful attention to cleanliness and cooling as any other milk. Goat milk has a more easily digestible fat and protein content than cow milk. The increased digestibility of protein is of importance to infant diets (both human and animal), as well as to invalid and convalescent diets. Furthermore, glycerol ethers are much higher in goat than in cow milk which appears to be important for the nutrition of the nursing newborn. Goat milk tends to have a better buffering quality, which is good for the treatment of ulcers. Goat milk can successfully replace cow milk in diets of those who are allergic to cow milk. The natural homogenization of goat milk is, from a human health standpoint, much better than the mechanically homogenized cow milk product.","808":"Goats are much cleaner than cows; I have never, in my many year of goat keeping, had a goat poop or pee while I was milking her. You can sweep up goat poops with a broom; you can not sweep up a cow pie. I can haul 4-5 goats in the back of my covered mid sized pickup truck; I wouldn't be able to transport on cow in the same truck. While my cow's milk was delicious, I find properly handled goat milk even better. Goat milk is just plain ol' better for you than cow milk health wise. I have heard many stories of human babies not being able to handle cow milk, where I know for a fact, that not only can these babies handle goat milk, but they thrive on it. I know that goat milk has saved human infants lives.","809":"Furthermore, glycerol ethers are much higher in goat than in cow milk which appears to be important for the nutrition of the nursing newborn. Alkalinity vs. Acidity: The reaction of goat milk is alkaline, the same as Mother's milk. Cow milk produces an acid reaction. An acid environment promotes the growth of bacteria, fungi, and virus. Goat milk protein is more easily digested than cow milk protein: The curd in goat milk is small and light, hence easily digested. The curd in cow milk is large and dense. Goat milk is 2% curd (which precipitates in the stomach) as compared with 10% curd in Cow milk. This difference in curd tension is attributed to the low levels of alpha-s1-casein in goat milk, compared to cow milk. This is a key reason why goat milk is considered more easily digestible than cow milk.","810":"Goat Milk vs. Cow Milk Goat Milk vs. Cow Milk Goats' Milk Is More Beneficial To Health Than Cows' Milk, Study Suggests ScienceDaily (July 31, 2007) \u2014 Researchers have carried out a comparative study on the properties of goats' milk compared to those of cows' milk.

Goat milk, due to absence or low levels of alpha-s1-casein, produces curds that are weaker and less firm than cow milk. Goat milk has better buffering capacity than cow milk at the pH-temperature conditions that exist in the stomach. This can be very useful for those with gastric ulcers. Goat milk contains bio-active factors such as insulin-like growth factor. The Process of Making Yogurt Changes the Casein From Elaine Gottschall: When we make yogurt and the pH falls to about 4.5 rather than 7.1-2 (as in fluid milk), the proteins are denatured which means that because of the acidity, the proteins lose their 3 dimensional structure (sterochemistry) which would be the reason allergists worry about casein.","816":"While at the gross compositional level the amount of fat and protein is similar to that in cow milk, there are significant differences between the types of fat, protein and minor components present. When compared with cow milk, goat milk is considered to provide advantages due to the following factors: The fat in goat milk is in smaller globules. Smaller fat globules provide a greater surface area for enzymes to break down the particles, enabling easier digestion. In addition, goat milk lacks 'agglutinin', a factor present in cow milk that makes fat globules in milk clump together. Goat milk fat contains a significantly greater proportion of short and medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) than cow milk fat, which contributes to more rapid digestion. Goat milk is higher in caproic (C6), caprylic (C8), capric (C10), which total 16% in goat milk (compared with 7% in cow milk).","817":"Much documentation exists showing the uniquely beneficial effects of those MCT, medium chain fatty acids in various medical problems, disorders and diseases, such as those suffering from malabsorption syndromes chluria, steatorrhe, hyperlipoproteinemia intestinal resection, coronary bypass, premature infant feeding, childhood epilepsy, cystic fibrosis, gallstones, angcontributeto general thriftiness of children.(5) Goat milk provides 13% more calcium, 25% more Vit B-6, 47% more Vit A, 134% more potassium and 350% more niacin than cow milk.

Spanish and South African goats are best known for meat producing ability (e.g.the South African Boer Goat ), whilst Indian and Nubian derived goat breeds are dual-purpose meat and milk producers. Dairy breeds All does that have produced kids should give milk, but some breeds give more than others, and selection processes have resulted in a number of breeds that are kept largely for milk produciton. Swiss goat breeds are the world's leaders in milk production. Goat milk casein and goat milk fat are more easily digested than that from cow milk. Goat milk is valued for the elderly, sick, babies, children with cow milk allergies, patients with ulcers, and even preferred for raising orphan foals or puppies. Fat globules in goat milk are smaller than in cow milk and remain dispersed longer.","819":"To the average punter \u2013 well certainly to me \u2013 \u2018dairy-free\u2019 would suggest free of the milk of all animals.

Goat milk is much higher in SCFA and MCFA than cow milk. This means that those SCFA and MCFA have a larger surface-to-volume ratio and are better digested and absorbed than the long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) prevalent in cow milk.11 In fact, a recent study found that \u201clevels of the metabolically valuable short- and medium-chain fatty acids\u2014caproic, caprylic, capric and lauric\u2014are significantly higher in...goat (milk) than in cow milk.\u201d12 These higher levels of easy-to-digest SCFA and MCFA are broken down quicker and more completely than the LCFA abundant in cow milk.","821":"Research shows that goat milk has better digestibility, buffering capacity and alkalinity than cow milk.1,12 Several properties testify to the superiority of goat milk. First, goat milk biologically resembles human milk. Second, goat milk contains a low level of allergy-producing substances. Third, it digests quickly and absorbs completely. Last, goat milk is an alkaline powerhouse. Biological Resemblance to Human Milk: Goat milk has a similarity to human milk that is unmatched in bovine (cow) milk, which may be at the root of goat milk\u2019s healing properties. A study by the International Journal of Food Science Nutrition found that \"goat milk has a very different profile of the non-protein nitrogen fraction to cow milk, with several constituents such as nucleotides (DNA structure) having concentrations approaching those in human breast milk\".2 So at the very base of the DNA structure of goat milk are similarities to the DNA structure of human milk.","822":"Thus, why milk sheep? Is it because it is a better alternative to wool and meat sheep farming, or is it an alternative to cow dairying, which has had times of uncontrolled surplus production, quota restrictions, and cow milk intolerance problems, which the medical research community has not adequately addressed? But how to justify milk sheep economically? Just because sheep milk has a higher solids content than cow and goat milk, and therefore has a much better cheese yield? That is not necessarily a good enough reason for the general negative economics of scale. Actually, buffalo (16.9%), reindeer (36.7%) and yak (17.9%) milk have at least the same high solids contents (Path, 1995; Kon and Cowie, 1961) as sheep milk for superior cheese yield compared to cow milk (12.6%), and they would have the economics of scale advantage as cows do.","823":"Supplier list Where to get what you need.

The number of features considered for splitting at any given branch point is the square root of the total number of features. In test mode, each tree classifies a new test data point. The trees then get an equal vote on the point's class. There are between 50 and 500 trees. Stochastic discrimination, random forests and boosting tend to form more accurate classifiers than decision trees alone, since they are able to better capture the true structure of the data. Using the importance variable method, these classifiers can be used in place of single trees and still find important dependencies in the data. PROBABILISTIC GRAPHICAL MODELS \"Potential applications of Bayesian networks are greatest in the introduction of cost-based decision-making influence diagrams.\" Probabilistic graphical models can express either grids of locally correlated variables (Markov random fields) or directed causal relations between variables (Bayesian networks \/ directed graphical models), or mixes of the two (chain graphs).","867":"trees ADTree - Class for generating an alternating decision tree.

Random subspaces are a popular ensemble construction technique that improves the accuracy of weak classifiers. It has been shown, in different domains, that random subspaces combined with weak classifiers such as decision trees and nearest neighbor classifiers can provide an improvement in accuracy. In this paper, we apply the random subspace methodology to the 2-D face recognition task. The main goal of the paper is to see if the random subspace methodology can do as well, if not better, than the single classifier constructed on the tuned face space. We also propose the use of a validation set for tuning the face space, to avoid bias in the accuracy estimation. In addition, we also compare the random subspace methodology to an ensemble of subsamples of image data. This work shows that a random subspaces ensemble can outperform a well-tuned single classifier for a typical 2-D face recognition problem.","870":"One of the most important uses of accurate class probability estimates in machine learning and data mining is prediction in the presence of arbitrarily large costs associated with the different kinds of errors. We tested our method for different cost models and application domains from the UCI ML repository and, for the majority of the tasks, its probability estimates improve over the probability estimates of both decision trees and bagged Probability Estimation Trees (unpruned, uncollapsed, and smoothed decision trees; B-PETs) - one of the best existing class probability estimators. For evaluating the quality of the predictions in a cost-sensitive context, we employed the paired BDeltaCost procedure introduced by Margineantu \\& Dietterich (2000). Perfect Random Tree Classifiers Author: Adele Cutler (Utah State University) Guohua Zhao (AT\\&T) Abstract: Ensemble classifiers are some of the most accurate general-purpose classifiers available.","871":"This ensures that the training data is separate from the test data, and is called ``cross-validation''.) For our reference implementation of PILFER, we use a random forest [6] as a classifier. Random forests create a number of decision trees (in our case, 10), and each decision tree is made by randomly choosing an attribute to split on at each level, and then pruning the tree. The exact workings of the classifier are beyond the scope of this paper. We evaluated a number of other classifiers as well, including SVMs [11], rule-based approaches, normal decision trees, and Bayesian approaches, but the overall accuracies of most of the classifiers were not different with statistical significance. Accuracies for some of these other classifiers are shown in appendix A. For a complete discussion of classifiers and text classification in general, the reader is directed to a machine learning text such as [20] or [ 11].","872":"This bug could cause See5\/C5.0 to crash, or to give incomplete results with the cross-reference facility. Release 2.06 New algorithm for softening thresholds See5\/C5.0 decision trees have an option to soften threshold tests for continuous attributes; values near the threshold cause both the low and high branches to be evaluated and combined probabilistically. The methods for finding the bounds within which this combination is invoked have been re-designed to make them both faster and more effective. This option can lead to noticeably better predictive performance and is now recommended for applications with many continuous attributes. Improved boosting The boosting option generates several classifiers that are then voted to give a final prediction. This option, which is commonly used to increase classification accuracy, has been updated to give better results, especially on applications that use differential misclassification costs.","873":"With the SMO, linear models may be used to implement non-linear class boundaries. As the meta-learnerCostSensitiveClassifier works better with probability estimates, the SMO option BuildLogisticModelswas set to True. \u2022 J48 is Weka's implementation of a C4.5 decision tree learner. J48 was used for these experiments as it is not a black box approach and may provide added value to the classification tasks. MetaCost works better with unstable data and therefore the J48 option Unprunedwas set to True. \u2022 RandomForest is an ensemble classifier that consists of many RandomTrees, in this case 10. The output of the RandomForest is the class that is the statistical mode of the class's output by the individual trees. Weka defaults were used for the classifier. As a Random Forest classifier is a bagged classifier, more computer memory is required to run them than for the other base classifiers used.","874":"Figure 3. The mean TPR, FPR, accuracy and G-Mean of the evaluated feature selection methods (Document Frequency, Fisher Score, Gain Ratio) as a function of the number of top features (50, 100, 200 and 300) . DF was accurate for all sizes of top features. FS performed very well, especially when fewer features were used (top 50 and top 100). 5.1.3 Classifiers Figure 4 depicts the mean TPR, FPR, accuracy and G-Mean for each classifier as a function of the OpCoden-gram size using the TF representation. The performance of both the Na\u00efve Bayes and the Boosted Na\u00efve Bayes was the worst for all then-gram sizes, having the lowest mean TPR, accuracy and G-Mean, and highest mean FPR. The remaining the classifiers performed very well, having the Random Forest, Boosted Decision Trees and Decision Trees outperforming.","875":"The mean accuracy, TPR and G-Mean of the 2-gram outperforms all the othern-grams with the lowest mean FPR for all classifiers, but not significantly. Figure 4. The mean TPR, FPR, accuracy and G-Mean for each classifier (using TF representation) as a function of the OpCoden -gram size. The performance of both the Na\u00efve Bayes and the Boosted Na\u00efve Bayes was worst for alln-gram sizes having the lowest mean TPR, accuracy and G-Mean and highest mean FPR. The mean accuracy, TPR and G-Mean of the 2-gram outperforms all the othern-grams with the lowest mean FPR for all classifiers. Classifiers differ in performance within different domains and the best fitted classifier can often be identified by experimentation. From the results we conclude that for this problem domain, complex classifiers, such as the ensemble Random Forest algorithm[44] which induces many decision trees and then combines the results of all trees, and the boosted decision tree[48] generate a more accurate classifier.","876":"In this way, important process parameters relating to success or failure are found. TREES AND NETWORKS \"Stochastic discrimination, random forests and boosting tend to form more accurate classifiers than decision trees alone.\" Learning binary decision trees is about finding a feature variable and a value that best splits the data into two label groups until the data is pure, or nearly so, at 'leaf' level. For example, to divide cars into a high-mileage and low-mileage group, he best split variable might be weight (with two tonnes and over being the cut-off point). So, the cut-off point is divided down the tree, reusing feature variables as necessary, until the data in the 'leaves' is pure, or within a small percentage of being so. Stopping at a split level that is too high in the tree will lead to 'underfitting'.","877":"In this paper we evaluated the visual tuning strategy only on C4.5 decision trees. From the research and also from the practical usability point of view, it would be important to extend this study and consequently develop a Weka package that would allow simultaneous tuning of different decision tree models (e.g. CART[4]). Some of the areas where visual tuning could also be applied are comprehensible ensembles of classifiers or variations of decision tree models (e.g, Alternating decision trees[42]). These models combine boosted decision stumps in a structure where visual constraints could be beneficial for the end-user in different areas of bioinformatics.

Boosting as a representative ensemble learning method, which aggregates simple weak learners, can be seen as a flat tree structure when each learner is a decision-stump. The flat structure ensures reasonably smooth decision regions for good generalisation, however, is not optimal in classification time. A hierarchical structure having many short paths, i.e. a decision tree, is advantageous in speed but is notoriously bad at generalisation. Random Forest, an ensemble of random trees for good generalisation, has been emerging in related tasks including object segmentation and key-point recognition problems. In this tutorial, we review Boosting and Random Forest and present comparative studies with insightful discussions. The tutorial is comprised of largely three parts: Boosting and tree structured classifiers, Random Forest, and Online learning as detailed below.","879":"Further, even when different splitting rules yield similarly accurate classifiers, the differences between them may still matter. With multiple classes, you might care how the errors are distributed across classes. Between two trees with equal overall error rates, you might prefer a tree that performs better on a particular class or classes. If the purpose of a decision tree is to yield insight into a causal process or into the structure of a database, splitting rules of similar accuracy can yield trees that vary greatly in their usefulness for interpreting and understanding the data. This paper explores the key differences between three important splitting criteria: Gini, Twoing and Entropy, for three- and greater-level classification trees, and suggests how to choose the right one for a particular problem type. Although we can make recommendations as to which splitting rule is best suited to which type of problem, it is good practice to always use several splitting rules and compare the results.","880":"The goal is to facilitate Bayesian inference techniques to a larger audience than just statisticians in Academia. The library is freely available from Insightful Corporation. . Murua, A. (2002), \"Upper bounds for error rates associated to linear combination of classifiers, \"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 9, 591-602. In this work I introduced a useful notion of weak dependence between many classifiers built using the same training data. I showed that if both this dependence is low and the expected margins are large, then decision rules based on linear combinations of these classifiers can achieve error rates that decrease exponentially fast. Several experiments showed that the three common methods used to construct multiple classifiers from the same training data -bagging, boosting and randomized trees (random forests)- produce mutually weakly dependent trees.","881":"The first method is based on encoding rule sets with bit string genomes and the second one utilizes Genetic Programming to create decision trees with arbitrary expressions attached to the nodes. Comparisons with some sophisticated standard approaches, such as C4.5 and Random-Forest, show that the performance of the evolved classifiers can be very competitive. We further demonstrate that both proposed approaches work well across different configurations of the EAs.

In our case, the data is imbalanced in real-life conditions and reflected by the test-set in our experiments, therefore, we would like to understand the optimal construction of a training-set for achieving the best performance in real-life conditions. Similarly to the work of[31], in our research we also consider the question of what is the appropriate proportion of examples of each class (benign and malicious) for learning if only a limited number of training instances can be used altogether. Their work considers the case of Decision Trees induction on 26 different data-sets. We, on the other hand, focus on the single problem of interest here--malware detection--but consider eight different classifiers.","884":"In a hierarchical mixture, individual hypotheses are combined by a gating network that decides, based on the features of the data point, what weights should be employed. This differs from Adaboost and other additive ensembles, where the weights are determined once during training and then held constant thereafter. Discussion The majority of research into ensemble methods has focused on constructing ensembles of decision trees. Decision tree learning algorithms are known to suffer from high variance, because they make a cascade of choices (of which variable and value to test at each internal node in the decision tree) such that one incorrect choice has an impact on all subsequent decisions. In addition, because the internal nodes of the tree test only a single variable, this creates axis-parallel rectangular decision regions that can have high bias. Consequently, ensembles of decision tree classifiers perform much better than individual decision trees.","885":"Enter your e-mail into the 'Cc' field, and we will keep you updated with your request's status. Lecture popularity: You need to login to cast your vote. Description Random forests are one of the best performing methods for constructing ensembles. They derive their strength from two aspects: using random subsamples of the training data (as in bagging) and randomizing the algorithm for learning base-level classifiers (decision trees). The base-level algorithm randomly selects a subset of the features at each step of tree construction and chooses the best among these. We propose to use a combination of concepts used in bagging and random subspaces to achieve a similar effect. The latter randomly select a subset of the features at the start and use a deterministic version of the base-level algorithm (and is thus somewhat similar to the randomized version of the algorithm).","886":"If designed correctly, requires minimal maintenance.

GARDENING BUYING GUIDES Choosing the Right Mulch Made Easy Send to a friend X Close One of the most beneficial and affordable treatments for your garden is mulch. It's available in many forms, from shredded wood and bark nuggets to rubber and stone. When mulch is spread out in a 2-4-inch layer on top of a garden bed, it will protect against erosion, help prevent pests from invading and conserve moisture, saving you time and money spent on repairs to your garden later.","898":"Or, you could accept that you have a natural drainage ditch and fill it with a jumble of large stones that will slow the water down as it passes through. Report GardenClub Aug. 10, 2009 03:06PM @ Georgiana Thanks for your comment. Any organic mulch, such as shredded bark, should be fine. No matter what type you choose, keep it a few inches away from the trunk. This helps minimize disease and insect problems, since mulch holds moisture and that's what pests like. Report GardenClub Aug. 10, 2009 03:05PM @ Darlene Thanks for your comment. Cactus need very good drainage, especially at the soil line. If they're growing in nice, sandy soil they probably don't need any mulch at all. But if you choose to use one, make sure it's one that drains, like stone, rather than one that holds moisture, like wood and bark mulches.","899":"Over the last ten years, the Department has investigated the serious injuries of several youth that resulted from the use of chain saws to cut branches and trees, charged violations under HO 5, and assessed and collected civil money penalties because of those violations. However, as the Report implies, the use of chain saws by 16- and 17-year-olds would not be prohibited when cutting other materials such as metal, concrete, stone, and ice. The Department has also long taken the position that HO 5 prohibits the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to operate wood chippers to grind tree limbs, branches, and trunks into chips, mulch, or debris. Some questions have recently been raised concerning the appropriateness of this position, but the Department has been consistent in its application when the equipment is used to process wood and trees.","900":"the bunny hop 203 (1) Other oddball animal habitats 204 (1) Sustainable Hardscape Construction 205 (18) Fossil-Free Construction: Forgoing the Heavy Equipment 205 (1) Managing Your Site 206 (1) Storing materials and equipment safely 206 (1) Noise and dust control 207 (1) Erosion Protection during Construction and Beyond 207 (4) Controlling surface erosion 208 (2) Preventing landslides 210 (1) Creating Paved Surfaces for Patios, Paths, and More 211 (3) Making a concrete patio 211 (1) Placing unit pavers on a subslab 211 (1) Positioning unit pavers on sand 212 (1) Installing vegetated paving systems 212 (1) Spreading loose paving materials 213 (1) Opting for mulch 214 (1) Tips for Constructing Steps Sustainably 214 (1) Raising Earthen Garden Walls 215 (5) Getting the soil right 215 (1) Building a solid foundation 216 (1) Plastering your wall 216 (1) Putting your wall together 216 (4) Holding Back: Retaining Structures 220 (3) Living solutions to retaining challenges 220 (1) Piling up stone retaining walls 220 (1) Assembling block retaining walls 221 (1) Building earthen retaining walls 222 (1) Erecting wood and timber retaining walls 222 (1) Hardscape Maintenance 223 (8) Sustainable Surface Care: One Big Secret 223 (1) Hosing, Blowing, and Sweeping: Keeping Things Clean 224 (1) What's Noshing on My Deck?","901":"Very hot or very cold water can shock the roots and damage, or even kill your house plants. Making Your Own Distilled Water You can make your own distilled water at home. You can either use tap water or catch rain water in a bucket or barrel. Rain water works well for making distilled water as long as the water is not too acidic. If the rain water in your area tends to be acidic, you are better off using tap water. Acids don\u2019t dissipate well and can damage your plants. Fill the container with water from the tap and set it outside. If you will be using rain water, place a clean container outside to catch the rain. Leave the container outside for two days to allow the chlorine or other minerals to dissipate. The water is then ready to use on your plants.","902":"You can purchase distilled water at the grocery store or make your own distilled water at home. Why Distilled is Better than Tap Water Tap water contains chemicals, such as chlorine, that are used to treat the public water supply. These chemicals are damaging to plants. The effect of the chemicals is more profound on your house plants than in your outdoor plants. The reason is the chemicals in the water build up in the soil and aren\u2019t washed away by rain, as happens with outdoor plants. Chemicals aren\u2019t the only tap water problem. The hardness of the water can also impact your plants. If you have hard water, you will want to use distilled water for your house plants. Some plants are very sensitive to the minerals in hard water. Hard water is most often an issue with well water, but can be a problem with a municipal water supply as well.","903":"Plants and grass actually do better when fed rainwater instead of tap water, which is usually treated with softeners that actually inhibit plant growth. And, reports Davis, the lack of minerals in rainwater actually makes it more effective than tap water for shampooing or doing dishes. Using rainwater for plumbing uses can also extend the life of pipes and water heaters, since the salts added to tap water facilitate corrosion. Homeowners should set up a water purification system if they do plan to use rainwater for interior needs. Beyond the benefits to individual homeowners, rainwater harvesting can also be good for the local community, as it reduces the erosion, flooding and pollution runoff associated with heavy rainfall, and lessens reliance on public water supplies, alleviating some of the burden on utilities. Given these benefits, some states, including even drought-prone Texas, subsidize residential rainwater collection systems.","904":"The system of swales may be a shallow, almost unnoticeable, linear depression in a lawn area, or it may be a mock arroyo lined with plastic and filled with cobbles and boulders to become a distinctive element in the landscape. The arroyo may be landscaped with appropriate plants within this arroyo or plants may line its margin. The main purpose is to direct the water from near the house to a point of usage away from the foundation and among plants needing deeper irrigation. Passive water harvesting may not provide all the irrigation needed by trees in the landscape, but will reduce the need for purchased or pumped water, reducing costs for maintaining the trees. An interesting fact, long apparent to gardeners, is that rain water is better for plants than tap water. There is no reason to waste rainwater by allowing it to runoff.","905":"Bottled water is not as well regulated as municipal water and often is not even particularly pure. Much bottled water is just tap water anyway. Bottled water is more expensive per gallon than gasoline and incurs a huge carbon footprint from it transportation. The discarded bottles are a blight in the landscape and the landfill. If you want to carry water with you, use a refillable bottle. Go beyond the lawn Naturalize your lawn using locally appropriate plants that are hardy and don\u2019t need a lot of water. Water in the coolest part of the day to minimize evaporation. Drip irrigation is a better choice than using a sprinkler system. Harvest your rainwater Put a rain barrel on your downspouts and use this water for irrigation.

More Information How To Make Your Own Rain Barrel A simple and inexpensive way to catch and store rainwater that can later be used to water your lawns and gardens during dry periods. ABOUR RAIN BARRELS Why is a Rain Barrel good for the Environment? Water coming from your tap has been treated at the treatment plant in order to make it suitable for drinking. This process requires large amounts of energy; therefore using rainwater instead of treated tap\/city water for irrigating plants saves energy. Second, stormwater falling on an impervious area such as pavement, concrete, or a rooftop generally drains straight to a storm drain, ditch, or directly into a creek instead of soaking into the ground.","907":"Researchers found that the average number of emergency room visits increased by 11 percent for four days after any amount of rainfall. The study concluded that the incidence of waterborne illnesses occur more frequently even after comparatively mild rain events. Study collaborator Sandra McLellan is a senior scientist at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee\u2019s Great Lakes W.A.T.E.R. Institute (Wisconsin Aquatic Technology and Environmental Research). According to McLellan, water leaving Milwaukee\u2019s treatment plant is very high quality. Dr. Gorelick stated that the mystery \u201cis what happens to water between the time it leaves the treatment plant and gets to your tap.\u201d The answer to that mystery likely lies in an aging infrastructure of pipes used to transport water. These pipes are kept under pressure and are designed to keep contaminants out of the treated water. However, this pressure can fail after a water main break results in a breach.","908":"Re-water | Texas Water Resources Institute TWRI Publications txH2O Fall 2011 Re-water Texas AgriLife Research Texas AgriLife Extension Service College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Texas Water Resources Institute About People What We Do Publications Resources Search Search this site Search not helping?

But in order to conserve and better manage precious water resources, some Texas cities are using innovative water reclamation technologies to speed up and improve this process.","909":"You are left to watch your garden wither away. There is an option that might save your garden. Consider collecting the rain. Throughout history, innovative rain collecting devices have been used to sustain plants and people when indoor plumbing was less commonplace. You too can collect the rain using simple rain barrels with minimal expense. Rain water is actually better for your plants. Municipal water is generally chlorinated and contains minerals and chemicals that can harm your plants. Also plants prefer the warm rain water over cold tap water. Saving rainwater may also put a dent in your city water bills. On a 1000 sq ft roof, 600 gallons of water can be collected for every inch of rainfall! So in the summer months when there is a light rainfall but not enough moisture to saturate your garden soil, you can still collect plenty of water in your rain barrel to replenish your plants without violating water restrictions.","910":"You don\u2019t have to continue allowing your family to take in harmful forms of contamination. Even if the levels are below what the EPA guidelines are, there are many studies out there that link serious health problems, including cancer, to drinking water. The risk is much too high to feel safe about drinking plain tap water. The cost of bottled water continues to increase all the time. It also gives a false sense of safety that you are drinking pure water. Bottled water has contaminants in it, just like tap water. The plastic bottles that the product is sold in cause environmental problems, too, so you need to find a better solution than buying bottled water. Water purifiers from Aquasana can be found online if you aren\u2019t able to buy them locally. They have terrific reviews and that is certainly encouraging.","911":"These include: Enjoying better tasting water \u2013 Chlorine and other additives placed into public water supplies can give water a funny flavor that bothers many.

Environmentally conscious magazines sell kits to convert a car to bio diesel, ethanol and other fuels. The kits, as long as the buyer installs them properly work. Using such kits requires that a person have mechanical competence and a lot of time to do the conversion. For now, those who are in a situation where they do not have to wait for an environmentally friendly vehicle to enter their price range can drive hybrid cars,electric cars, or cars that get high gas mileage. The hybrid, as long as acceleration is not a concern for the owner is the most viable option. Hybrids contain two drive shafts and can switch between all-electric and all-gasoline operation. During normal driving, the car will switch trains depending on which drive shaft can handle the tasks asked of it more efficiently.","922":"Contrary to the Japanese hybrid pioneers, European vehicle manufacturers have continued to depend on diesel technology and, in addition, have focused their research on fuel cell and hydrogen technologies. These technologies will not be ready for use until sometime between 2010 and 2020, at the earliest. Manufacturers and experts are having technical debates on the strengths and weaknesses of diesel and hybrid technologies. As a result, consumers have become more confused and have not been encouraged to embrace environmentally friendly technologies. While the strength of diesel lies in long-distance journeys, hybrid engines are more efficient in cities, on short trips with a high rate of stop-and-go. The air pollution debate in Europe and the success of hybrid cars in the U.S. and Japan could put the hybrid engine on the fast track to success in Europe, as well.","923":"Schneider National has been a Detroit Diesel customer since 1991, and more than 90 percent of its fleet is equipped with Detroit Diesel engines. \"Detroit Diesel's responsiveness, people, and above all, quality, keeps us coming back.

The difference is all but wiped out when you consider the efficiency of the fuel you are using. Diesel engines, especially when used for long distances, are considerably more efficient, and diesel fuel could actually end up costing less. By contrast, a gasoline engine could be cheaper for fleets that make shorter trips. Environmental Considerations There is a growing concern regarding the environmental implications of today\u2019s transportation options. Governments worldwide are inclined to reward businesses that opt for newer technology, such as hybrid engines and electric vehicles. However, the debate between diesel and gasoline engines as the more environmentally friendly option is unsettled.

Indeed, I\u2019ve used Python for modeling; not a climate-related model, but a relatively complex model in the software engineering domain itself (as yet unpublished). I did consider building my model in R, but ultimately chose Python, almost entirely on the basis that itis object-oriented. Though Python lacks the specialised libraries of R, it makes architectural design easier. It seems to have just enough in the way of functional language structures that succinctly writing model equations is not too much of a chore. I do make use of polymorphism, which I think has helped in achieving a reasonably clean design in my case.

So that\u2019s how you get data from R to Python: by sending a string (the variable name you want to retrieve in R) to ther object.
